## Anne's Sub

# Chapter One: The Diner

The Mercedes needed new spark plugs. 

Anne had known it for weeks. She could feel it in the slight hesitation on cold starts, and in the occasional roughness at idle that smoothed out once the engine warmed. She’d been ignoring it the way she ignored most things that required attention: by filling her days with work so completely that there was no room left for maintenance, reflection, or anything that might crack the careful architecture of her routine she had built around herself for the past two years.

St. Helena to Vallejo at 7:30 AM. Vallejo to St. Helena at 6:45 PM. The blue 300 SEL traced the same route back and forth every day, so reliably that the regulars along Highway 29 could set their watches by it. Sometimes it cruised by on the way back to St. Helena earlier, and sometimes later, depending on whether there were many house calls – but always along the same route, and always driven by the same woman bearing a composed, unreadable expression that showed nothing of the pain that lay beneath it.

Her name was Anne Marquez, and the letters after it in her business card, M.D., had defined her for two decades. At forty-one, she had a bustling practice that spanned the valley, from the old farming families in Calistoga to the new money in Yountville, all of them trusting her with their most intimate secrets and their fears about mortality.

She was good at this work. She had always been good at it. The structure of the medical process – anamnesis, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis – was a framework that imposed order and structure on the messy chaos of slowly failing human bodies.

Anne’s focus on her work, however, was not driven by a financially based need to increase her consult from the relatively small pool of affluent patients she saw. Deep down, she knew her focus on work was because of a still-open wound, one she had deferred treating, because only thinking about it made her reel in anguish.

Anne no longer counted the days consciously, but her soul kept the tally anyway: two years, three months, and eleven days since Julia had passed. The anniversary made itself felt as a tide of self-reproach, sorrow and guilt, an ache that waxed sharp and burdensome in November, and waned through spring and summer, but never disappeared.

Julia had been Anne’s slave for fifteen years: her property, her responsibility, her joy, her purpose beyond her professional practice. When the blinding, crippling headaches had started, and the MRI had shown the glioblastoma spreading through Julia’s brain like frost across a window, Anne had moved all the levers she had known, to try to do something against that mortal foe. Within eight months, however, Anne had watched helplessly as the woman she owned and loved became a shadow of herself… and then nothing at all.

Anne’s knowledge about what was happening to Julia had been the cruellest part of it all. She understood exactly what was happening. She could read the scans and the bloodwork results like a text written in a language she’d spent decades mastering. 
She also knew when the treatments stopped working. She knew, before Julia did, that the finite time they had been given after her diagnosis was now being counted in days rather than weeks. She had held that knowledge within herself, and her pride prevented her from sharing it – or from putting it down.

Julia had asked to spend her last days at home, in their bed. This had been a hard choice for Anne to grant – her medical knowledge screamed that she should remain in a controlled environment, but her humanity prevailed, and she had granted that request. She was with Julia through those last times; and she had watched as the monitors ticked, removing one less bead from Julia’s life.

When Julia closed her eyes for the last time, Anne’s face was the last thing she saw.

Two years, three months, eleven days ago, fifteen years of service and trust – of a surrender so complete that Anne had come to assume it’d never end – were over. 

That day, Anne’s world had shattered – and she wasn’t sure whether it could ever be made whole again.

Sometimes the house in St. Helena still felt and smelled like Julia was there, as if there was some olfactory or emotional ghost that Anne’s memory conjured in quiet, lonely moments that had been populated with her slave’s presence, almost as if there was a phantom pain of the soul.

Work became Anne’s coping mechanism. She buried herself in medical studies, conferences, specialisation courses and seminars, attempting to drown that part of herself that clamoured loudly to shatter, wail, grieve, and slowly, painfully put itself back together again.

She kept Julia’s collar, carefully preserved in a wooden box within Anne’s closet. She had soldered it around her slave’s throat on their fifth anniversary and had cut it from Julia’s cold neck with her own hands before the cremation, eyes stinging with long-held tears.

The severed metal circlet was now a mute witness to a broken loop of service, love, and devotion. Anne could not bear to look at it, but neither could she throw it away.

She had not wanted to take another servant since then. The hunger for guiding someone, for shaping them, moulding them to be an image of her will that had defined her for fifteen years was now numb, curled up and hurting in the deepest, most tender recesses of her heart – and Anne let it sleep.

The diner appeared on her right, the same squat building she passed twice daily without stopping. Marge’s, according to the hand-painted sign, though Anne had never learned whether Marge was the owner, a former owner, or simply a name someone had liked the sound of. It was the kind of place that existed outside the wine country’s carefully curated dining ecosystem. It had no tasting menus, nor did it boast of farm-to-table directness. Marge’s offered coffee, pancakes, eggs, and hash browns – sturdy, reliably comforting food that made no apologies for itself.

Anne’s stomach growled. She’d skipped breakfast again. She had been skipping it for months, actually – and her body was beginning to register complaints she couldn’t ignore forever. The hesitation lasted only a moment. She signalled, slowed down, and pulled her classic Mercedes into the worn asphalt that paved the diner’s lot.

---

Inside, the eatery was nearly empty. Two older men at the counter, locals by the look of them, nursed coffee and the remnants of a conversation. A family of tourists, in a corner booth, consulted a map with the focused, hurried intensity of people who had somewhere else to be sooner rather than later. Anne chose a table by the window, positioning herself with her back to the wall – an old habit which she’d never managed to break, a remnant from her early days as a servant in Master Roger’s dungeon, where the smallest mistake was punished with a robust paddling – and reached for the laminated menu, tucked at an awkward angle behind the napkin dispenser.

After a few minutes where Anne half consulted the menu and half reminisced about the times she had been to places just like this when she was in college on her way to southern California during the summer, a clear, soprano voice broke the air.

“May I take your order, Miss? Would you like some coffee?”

Anne blinked and looked up, focussing on the presence who had startled her reverie.

The waitress in front of her was young, in her mid-twenties, perhaps, sporting honey-blonde hair pulled back in a low ponytail and bright, sparkling, spring-sky blue eyes. She was certainly pretty, but that wasn’t what caught Anne’s attention. It was the way in which the girl stood: her weight balanced evenly, shoulders relaxed but not slack, chin slightly lowered in a posture that was attentive without being overly obsequious.

And there was something more.

It was the way she’d said “Miss” – not “ma’am,” “honey,” “darling,” or the other commonplace endearments that jaded service workers usually deployed like armour. “Miss,” clear and unaffected, as if it were the most natural form of address in the world.

“Yes, please,” Anne said. “Make it black, no sugar. Thank you.”

The girl, whose nametag read AMY in uppercase block letters, nodded and turned toward the coffee station. Anne watched her go, cataloguing details with the same automatic precision she brought to a patient’s assessment. The slight sway of her hips, unconscious and unhurried. The way her hands moved as she poured, economical and sure. The soft curve of her neck above the collar of her uniform shirt, pale and unmarked.

*Unmarked.*

That word surfaced unbidden, and Anne pushed it back down.

Amy returned with the coffee, setting it down with a small, careful motion that placed the cup’s handle at a perfect angle for Anne’s right hand. “Miss, do you know what you’d like, or do you need a little longer?”

“Pancakes, please,” Anne said. “And scrambled eggs. Not too dry, if possible.”

“Hash browns?”

“Definitely.”

Amy wrote nothing down. She simply nodded, memorising everything Anne said, and her blue eyes met Anne’s for a moment. They were open and unguarded, with none of the wariness that usually creeps into the jaded gazes of service personnel.

“Coming right up, Miss.”

Then she was gone, moving toward the kitchen with unhurried grace.

Anne wrapped her hands around the coffee cup, letting the heat seep into her palms, pondering about what she had just witnessed.

The girl was submissive. Anne would have staked her medical licence on it. 

She was not trained, and was almost certainly not conscious of her nature, but the markers were unmistakable to anyone who knew how to read them. Her attentiveness was natural – instinctive, even, with no trace of it being forced or rehearsed in advance. 

She clearly took pleasure in service, which was evident in how her expression had softened into a barely sketched smile when she’d set down the cup. Furthermore, her demeanour was right – she’d deferred without diminishing herself and had been respectful without being servile.

Anne’s observations, though, were clinical, and meant nothing emotionally – at least, not at first.

She saw submissives everywhere – at the grocery store, in her waiting room, at the petrol station where she filled the Mercedes twice a week. The world was full of people whose natures went unrecognized, even by themselves. But that was none of Anne’s business.

She had no interest in taking on a new servant – much less a slave. She felt she had no capacity left in her for the emotional investment it would require. She was here for pancakes, nothing more.

---

The food arrived ten minutes later, presented with the same quiet competence Amy had shown throughout. The eggs were perfect – soft, slightly glossy curds, exactly the texture Anne preferred. The pancakes were golden and uniform. The hash browns were crisp at the edges and tender within. It was diner food, with the right amount of greasy sheen, unpretentious and honest, and Anne found herself eating with more appetite than she’d felt in months.

Amy checked on Anne once, halfway through the meal, with a simple enquiry: “Is everything okay, Miss?” Anne, caught mid-bite, nodded to the girl and sipped some coffee to wash down the hash browns she was consuming. Amy returned to her rounds, and, as she consumed her meal, Anne watched Amy work in brief glimpses.

The family in the corner booth had settled for breakfast, and Anne quietly assessed how Amy handled them. Longing crept into Anne’s heart as she watched the young woman engaging with the children, patient and warm but without being condescending. It made her think of Julia. She had been good with children too. She had been good handling everyone, but it was with children where she had particularly shined. Perhaps that is why she had chosen child psychology as her career path.

When the check came, Anne left a twenty-dollar bill on a twelve-dollar tab. It was too much – and conspicuously so – but she found she didn’t care. The food had been good, the diner’s ambiance had been comforting, and Amy had been a most excellent servant. No, not servant, server, Anne caught herself thinking.

A few moments later, she was out the door and into the parking lot before she could second-guess herself, her heels clicking on the old asphalt as she made her way to her Mercedes.

The engine caught on the first try, the hesitation less pronounced in the midday warmth. Anne pulled back onto the highway, heading north toward her first appointment of the afternoon: a retired vintner with gout and a stubborn refusal to modify his diet. She had the conversation memorized by now, almost like a ritual: the mild warnings, recommendations, and gentle reminders about what would happen if he didn’t cut back on shrimp, eggs and his own wine. He would nod, promise to do better, and be back in six weeks with the same complaints. Visiting him gave her practice a predictable and oddly comforting rhythm.

As miles unwound beneath her wheels, though, Anne found her thoughts drifting back to Marge’s diner. Back to the girl with the honey-blonde hair and the sky-blue eyes; to the way she’d said “Miss,” to the way her hands had moved when she poured the coffee, and the unmarked curve of her throat above the collar of her shirt.

*Stop it,* Anne told herself. *You’re not in the market. You’re not ready for *this.* You may never **be** ready for this again. What are you thinking?*

Those thoughts continued anyway, persistent like a low-grade fever, all the way to Calistoga and back.

---

Anne returned to the diner three days later.

It wasn’t a conscious decision, or at least that was what Anne told herself. She had a gap in her schedule, an hour between appointments that she usually spent catching up on paperwork in her car. But the paperwork could wait, and she hadn’t eaten since the night before, and the diner was right there, and – 

And she wanted to see if the girl would remember her.

Amy did. Her face brightened when Anne walked in, a genuine warmth that had nothing performative about it. “Good afternoon, Miss. Same table?”

“Please.”
Anne settled into the seat by the window, accepted the coffee Amy poured without being asked, and ordered a club sandwich she didn’t particularly want. She ate slowly, watching Amy work the room. The lunch rush was busier than the morning had been – lorry drivers, construction workers, a few wine tourists who’d wandered off the beaten path – and Amy navigated the rush with fluid poise, attending to each customer as if they were the only person in the room.

There was an older man in the kitchen, visible through the pass-through window, a big Black man with forearms like hams and a gentle face. Anne heard Amy call him Gus. She heard Gus, calling Amy “sweetheart,” but the word carried only easy-going affection. She heard Amy laugh at something one of the lorry drivers said, the sound bright and unforced, and Anne felt something shift in her chest, something that she didn’t want to examine too closely.

When the check came, Anne left another excessive tip. Amy caught her at the door.

“Miss? You left too much again.”

Anne turned. Amy was holding the twenty, her expression uncertain, as if she couldn’t decide whether to be grateful or concerned.

“I left exactly what I intended to leave,” Anne said.

“But …  “

“You’re *good* at your job.” Anne held Amy’s gaze, letting the words settle. “Take the money.”

A spark flickered in Amy’s blue eyes – surprise? Pleasure? Anne could not asy – and a hint of colour rose in the young woman’s cheeks. She lowered her chin in a small nod that was almost a curtsey. “Thank you, Miss.”

Anne drove north with the image of that nod burned into her memory. The slight dip of the head. The softening of the shoulders. The brief, slight bend of her knees. It was an unconscious, graceful display of submission, offered without understanding, and received by most without acknowledgment. But it resonated with Anne – and much louder that she was willing to admit.

Anne attempted to beat down the curiosity she felt.

*You’re playing with fire,* she told herself. *You’re going to get burned, or you’re going to burn ***her,*** and either way someone ends up hurt. Walk away, now!*

She went back the next day anyway.

And the day after that.

And the day after that.

---

By the end of the second week, Anne had learned the following: Amy was twenty-four. She was originally from San Franciscoy, had come to Yountville to take care of her uncle through the final stages of his illness, and had stayed to settle his affairs after he died. The diner job was temporary – she was covering for a woman named Maria who was on maternity leave – and paid just enough to cover the rent on her uncle’s old house while she sorted out the estate. She was supposed to go back to San Francisco eventually, to finish her degree at UC Berkeley, but there was a vagueness to her plans that suggested she wasn’t entirely sure what she was going back to.

Anne had learned most of this in fragments, pieced together from brief exchanges at the table, from overheard conversations with Gus, from the small details Amy let slip without seeming to realize she was sharing them. Amy was not guarded, not exactly, but there was a loneliness to her that Anne recognized – the particular isolation of someone who had never quite fit into the life they’d been given.

What Amy had learned about Anne was considerably less. Anne had offered her name, her profession in the vaguest terms, her appreciation for the food. She had not mentioned the house in St. Helena, or the practice that kept her driving up and down the valley, or the wooden box in her closet that contained a collar she couldn’t bear to touch. She had not mentioned Julia.

It was dishonest, this asymmetry, and Anne knew it. She was gathering information the way a predator gathers intelligence about prey, learning vulnerabilities and preferences and patterns while revealing nothing of her own. It was unfair. It was potentially dangerous. And she couldn’t seem to stop.

“You’re here a lot, Miss,” Amy observed one afternoon, refilling Anne’s coffee with that same careful attention to the angle of the handle. “I mean – it’s not like I mind. I just… noticed.”

“I pass through frequently,” Anne said. “For work.”

“What kind of work?”

“I’m a doctor. Internal medicine, mostly. House calls, for patients who can’t easily travel.”

Amy’s eyebrows rose. “House calls? I didn’t think doctors did that anymore.”

“Most don’t. I find it suits me.”

“Is it the driving, Miss?” 

“In part… But what I most value is the autonomy.” Anne took a sip of her coffee, watching Amy over the rim of the cup. “I prefer to work on my own terms.”

Something in Amy’s expression shifted – a flicker of recognition, perhaps. Or was it longing? Anne could not dissect that. “That must be nice,” she said quietly, “to have that kind of control over your life…”

*Control.*

The word hung in the air between them. 

Anne felt its weight settle into the conversation like a stone dropped into still water. Amy didn’t seem to notice what she’d said, or what it might reveal, but Anne noticed. Anne noticed everything.

“It has its compensations,” Anne said carefully. “And its costs.”

“What kind of costs, Miss?”

Anne thought of Julia. Of the empty house and the untouched collar and the two years she’d spent building walls so high she could barely see over them. Before she could stop herself, she set the cup down with a heartfelt sigh, and, in a tone that was much too longing for the setting, Anne said, “Loneliness. Sometimes.”

Amy nodded slowly, her blue eyes soft with understanding. “Yeah,” she said. “I know about that.”

The moment stretched, fragile and charged, then the bell over the door jangled and a group of tourists spilled in, loud and demanding, and Amy was gone, moving to greet them with that same patient grace she brought to everything.

Anne finished her coffee. She paid her check, left her tip, and walked out into the late afternoon sun. The Mercedes was warm from sitting in the lot, the leather seats almost too hot to touch, and she sat for a moment with her hands on the wheel, not starting the engine, not moving at all.

---

Loneliness, she had said. Sometimes.

It was the most honest thing she’d told Amy since they’d met. And she had no idea what to do with the fact that she’d said it – or with the answering recognition she’d seen in Amy’s eyes.

Julia would have known what to do. Julia had always known, had read Anne’s moods and needs with an intuition that felt almost supernatural. But Julia was gone, and Anne was alone, and somewhere in that diner was a girl who didn’t know what she was, who had no idea what Anne was, who smiled when Anne walked in as if her arrival were a gift – and the effect that young girl was having on Anne… was terrifying.

Anne started the car and drove home.

She didn’t stop at the diner the next day.

Or the day after that.

But on the third day, when she found herself inventing reasons to take the long route between appointments, she knew she had lost.
