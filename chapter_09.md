## Chapter Nine: The Claiming
Amy woke to the weight of metal on her throat.

For a moment, suspended in the mental fog between sleep and wakefulness, she didn’t understand what had changed. 

The bedroom was the same; the morning light slanted through the windows, and the valley stretched in green and gold beyond the glass, while the soft warmth of Anne’s body curved against her back. Everything was familiar, everything was right.

Then her fingers found the collar, and the *memory* of the previous night flooded back – the ceremony, the vows, the click of metal sealing around her throat like the physical form of a promise kept.

The collar had enough space around her neck to allow her to gently play with it by hooking a finger around it.

And when she came close to the mirror, she could read the engraving.

The words moved through her like a current, settling into her bones. 

This was real.

She was no longer Anne’s servant under consideration. 

She was Anne’s property now – wholly, completely, irrevocably owned, and the gold band, warming against the heartbeat on her neck, was definitive proof of that.

Amy kept tracing the smooth metal with her fingertips, feeling the slight ridge where the clasp had sealed. There was no escaping it. 

“You’re thinking very loudly, mine,” Anne murmured against her shoulder.

“Forgive me, Mistress. I didn’t mean to wake you.”

“You didn’t, Amy.” Anne’s arm tightened around her waist. “I’ve been awake for a while, watching you sleep.” Her lips brushed the back of Amy’s neck, just above where the collar sat. “And I was watching the collar catch the morning light. My collar, on my slave.”

The possessive weight in those words sent a shiver through Amy that had nothing to do with the morning chill.

Anne let her words decant a few minutes, then asked, “How does it feel, now that you’ve slept with it, mine? How do you feel, now that your wish became *real*?”

Amy considered the question. The leather collar had felt like a question, a possibility, a door held open. This felt different. This felt like an answer.

“It… It feels… like I’ve always been wearing it, Mistress,” said Amy softly. “Like… like it was always there, waiting for me to grow into it.”

Anne pressed a kiss to her shoulder. 

“Good. Because if you ever want it off… there is no way to do it, other than cutting it off of your cold, dead body, or a 6-hour surgery.”

“I know, Mistress.” Amy turned in Anne’s arms, facing her. In the morning light, Anne’s dark eyes were soft, unguarded. “I… I don’t ever want to wish your collar removed.”

They had breakfast on the patio, looking out over Julia’s garden.

The crocuses had given way to tulips now, and the first roses were beginning to bud on the trellis Anne had built years ago. Amy sat in her silk robe, bare underneath, the collar catching the sunlight every time she moved. Anne watched her over the rim of her coffee cup. Amy knew at once that her Mistress was plotting something.

“I want to take you somewhere today, mine,” Anne said.

“Where to, Mistress?”

“I want to go with you to Bodega Bay. There’s a restaurant there I used to visit with Julia. I’d like to share it with you.” Anne set down her cup. “But first… I have some instructions for you.”

Amy felt herself straighten, her body responding to the shift in Anne’s tone before her mind had fully registered it.

“You’re going to go upstairs and have a shower,” Anne said. “Then, you’re going to clothe yourself with that cute, new, white blouse and mid-thigh skirt outfit you bought a couple of weeks ago.” Her eyes held Amy’s. “Remember, mine. Clothed, not dressed.”

Amy’s breath caught. “Yes, Mistress.”

“Oh, and Amy?” Anne’s voice stopped her at the door. “Leave the scarf today. The collar stays visible.”

The drive to Bodega Bay took them down Highway 101, through Petaluma and into the rolling hills that led to the coast.

Anne had chosen to use the BMW convertible for the trip – the soft-top she almost never drove, the one that had sat in the garage gathering dust for years. 

Today, however, with the top down and the spring air rushing over them, using the convertible felt like a declaration: this is a day for new things.

Amy sat in the passenger seat, acutely aware of her body in ways she had never been before. The thin cotton of her clothing was the only thing between her skin and the world. 

The leather seat’s warmth against the back of her thighs, the blouse’s slight sheerness, and every shift of her hips reminded Amy of the fact that she was wearing nothing under her garments, and anyone who looked a little closely would notice it.

And Anne’s collar sat bright and unmistakable against Amy’s throat, catching the midmorning light and reflecting it back like a shiny beacon.

Ten minutes into the drive, Anne’s hand left the steering wheel and came to rest on Amy’s thigh.

“Spread your legs, mine.”

Amy obeyed and parted her knees. Anne’s hand slid to rest on Amy’s thigh, then moved to caress along it, lower, then higher, the fingertips tracing lazy patterns on the soft skin of her inner thigh.

“Does it excite you to be displayed like this, mine?” Anne asked, her eyes still on the road.

“Yes, Mistress.” Amy’s voice was barely a whisper.

“Tell me what you’re feeling.”

“I… I f-feel… exposed.” Amy swallowed, catching her breath, feeling her pulse beat rapidly against the collar. “A-anyone looking down from a lorry could see your hand on me, and… and realise…. that I’m… that I’m your slave, Mistress.”

“It excites you.” Anne’s words were not a question.

“…Y-yes, Mistress. It… it does.” Amy’s confession sounded like a capitulation.

Anne smiled – that small, knowing smile that always made Amy’s stomach flip. 

She said, “As it should be, mine. You were made for this, Amy. You were made to be seen, to be shown, to be owned.” Her hand slid higher still, fingertips brushing the crease where thigh met hip. “You… were made to be mine.”

A lorry rumbled past, its cabin high enough that the driver could have looked down and seen Anne’s hand disappearing beneath Amy’s skirt, her flushed cheeks, and the gold circlet gleaming at the young woman’s throat. 

Amy didn’t know if he looked. She didn’t care. All she knew was the heat building between her legs, and the steady certainty of Anne’s touch.

“M… Mistress? P-please… “

“Yes, mine?”

“P-please… a-angh… I, I… mnn… I n-need…”

“I… know… what you need, my slave,” said Anne as her hand withdrew, and Amy almost sobbed at the loss of that erotically charged contact. “But… not yet. We have somewhere to be first.”

---

They stopped for petrol in Petaluma.

Anne pulled into the station and turned off the engine. She reached into her purse and took out from it an expensive-looking tube of crushed cherry coloured lipstick.

“Put this on,” she said. “Then, go inside and pay for twenty dollars on pump three.”

Amy took the lipstick with trembling fingers. “Y-yes, Mistress.” As she painted her lips with a light coat of that intensely coloured lip gloss, Anne said in her slave’s ear, “By the way… the hem of your skirt is too low.”

Before Amy could respond, Anne reached over and gathered the skirt up, like Japanese schoolgirls do, folding the waistband down and pulling up the skirt until the hem rested right at the curve of Amy’s buttocks.

“Theeere,” Anne said, satisfaction warming her voice. “Much better.” 

Amy’s cheeks had gone from milky white to rose-coloured pink to light red as Anne fixed her outfit. She then looked at her slave and, brushing a fingertip along the young woman’s jawline, said, in a soft, tantalising whisper, “you’re so pretty when you blush… mine.”

Amy’s face felt as if it was burning as she stepped out of the car. The morning air was cool against her bare thighs and the exposed curve of her bottom that the shortened skirt barely managed to conceal. She could *feel* the weight of eyes on her as she walked across the forecourt. Whether those eyes on her were real or imagined, she couldn’t tell – and, in honesty, she no longer cared. 

It no longer was her place to care.

The collar at her throat, unblocked by the scarf she usually wore; the skirt that exposed more than it concealed; and the dew already making her slick at her most intimate, everything conspired against Amy to incredibly arouse and embarrass her at the same time.

It was infuriating.

It was also making her… *horny.*

Inside the convenience store, Amy stood at the counter, hyperaware of every inch of exposed skin. The clerk – a younger woman with dyed black hair, tattoos and piercings on her ears, eyebrows and nose septum – glanced at her as she rang up the gas, and softly said “cute cosplay” with a shy smile, but the man browsing the crisps aisle looked intently at her. 

Amy saw his eyes travel from her legs to her throat, saw them catch on the gold circlet around her neck, and the small furrow of confusion as he tried to understand what he was seeing.

Amy’s eyes caught the man’s discomfort and she heard a soft, frustrated grunt coming from him. A thought came, unbidden, and it surprised her with its fierceness. 

*That’s right, I’m dressed like a slutty Japanese schoolgirl, mate. Someone made me put this on and fixed my skirt to make me look even sluttier. I’m mortified, I’m dripping… and I… don’t care. Because I belong to that someone. Because I belong to her.*

Amy paid for the petrol and, as she walked back to the car, she noticed the man adjusting himself. 

She had *aroused* him to discomfort! 

Amy suddenly had a naughty thought.

With the slightest smile, battling her raging embarrassment, she walked right past him. 

She could hear him grunt in frustration as she did.

When she slid back into the passenger seat, her thighs were dewy and her heart pounding.

“Good girl,” Anne said, and the praise washed through Amy like sunlight. “You did beautifully.”

Amy blushed crimson and told Anne everything that had happened in the store.

“You… *naughty* tart…” said Anne, impressed. “That… that was brilliant. How did you feel, mine?”

“M-mortally embarrassed, Mistress…. a-and also… um… utterly *aroused.*”

Anne smiled enigmatically, then said, “We’ll just have to do something about it later, then, no?”

“Y-y-yes, Mistress.”

“Good.”

They ate lunch at a table by the window. Anne had fish chowder and soft-shell crab, whilst Amy chose steamed littlenecks and grilled bluefish, all washed down with a crisp, mineral white wine that tasted like the sea. 

Anne had let Amy fix her skirt before they went in, but the collar remained visible, drawing occasional glances from other diners that Amy pretended not to notice.

“Julia loved this place,” Anne said, looking out at the waves. “We used to come here on our anniversary. She said the view made her feel small in all the right ways.”

“I can see why, Mistress. I feel the same.” 

Amy reached across the table and touched Anne’s hand – the one that now wore a gold ring on its fourth finger. “Thank you for sharing it with me.”

“Thank you for being someone worth sharing it *with.*” 

Anne lightly held Amy’s hand over hers. 

“I wasn’t sure I’d ever bring anyone else here. For a long time, I thought this place belonged to her – to us, to what we’d been.” She paused. “But being with you taught me something, Amy. 

“Grief and love aren’t opposites. Making room for someone new in your life doesn’t mean betraying what came before.”

“I think Julia knew that, Anne,” Amy said softly. “I think she’d be glad.”

“I think so too.” Anne squeezed her hand. “I *know* so.”

---

The drive home was different.
Anne had given Amy a gift before they left the restaurant – a small velvet box that contained something that made Amy’s breath catch. 

It was a silvery egg, smooth and cool, attached to a slim remote.

“This little thing goes inside you, mine,” Anne had said, matter-of-factly. “It’ll be a way to remind you about… anticipation. 

“You are going to hold it inside your pussy for the drive home, and I will control when it pulses and when it stops. You mustn’t orgasm. Is that clear, mine?”

Amy’s face ignited in embarrassment.

“Y-y-yes… Yes, Mistress.”

Now, forty minutes into the drive back, Amy was positively damp.

The egg had hummed and vibrated inside her in unpredictable patterns during the drive back. Sometimes it was a steady, low vibration that made her squirm in frustration against the leather seat; other times she had felt sharp pulses that took her breath away and almost caused her to fail her order not to orgasm; and sometimes there was nothing at all, just the maddening awareness of it being *there*, inside Amy, lurking.

Everything was made worse by the fact that, whilst the drive out had been smooth, the drive back was anything but, snarled by droves of day trippers and tourists returning to their abodes or hotels.

Anne confronted the gridlock with patience, with one hand on the wheel and the other on the remote, watching the road with apparent calm while Amy fell apart beside her.

“Mistress… please…” Amy gasped, pleading, after a particularly intense burst. “I… I can’t…”

“You can.” Anne’s voice was steady. “You can, and you will, because I say so, because you’re mine.”

“I… Yes, Mistress, I am,” Amy whimpered. “I am yours, Mistress, but please…”

“Not yet.” Anne’s thumb moved on the remote, and the vibration dropped to a barely-there hum. “Soon. But not yet.”

By the time they pulled into the driveway in St. Helena, Amy was shaking, her thighs were slick with her dew, and her mind awash in a fog of desperate need. Anne turned off the engine and sat for a moment, studying her.

“You did well,” she said finally. “You pleased me.”

“… T-t-thank… you… Mn… M-m-mistress…” The words came out broken and tight out of Amy’s mouth.

“Now…” Anne said as soon as she opened Amy’s door. “Go to our bedroom, strip, and lie on the bed, on your back. Wait for me. Don’t touch yourself.”

Amy *rushed* upstairs to obey her.

The bedroom was cool and dim, the curtains drawn against the late afternoon sun.

Amy quickly took off her clothing and went to lay on the bed as instructed. 

Her skirt and blouse lay on the ground, forgotten by the urgency the girl was feeling. The egg still hummed inside her. 

Amy stared at the ceiling and at Julia’s portrait, watching from the opposite wall, and tried to remember how to breathe.

---

The egg suddenly stopped. 

Amy heard Anne’s footsteps in the hall outside the bedroom, then the creak of a drawer opening and the soft clink of something being lifted and examined.

Then Anne was in the doorway, and Amy’s breath stopped entirely.

Her Mistress had changed. She wore a black silk robe, loosely tied around her waist, and, in her hands, she held something Amy had never seen before. 

It was a harness made out of supple leather. 

Cradled within it, there was a deep burgundy shaft, smooth, and curved, and *unmistakable* in its purpose.

“I’m going to take you now, mine.” 

Anne said that with a soft, low voice. 

“I’ve been waiting to take you since the day you first knelt at my feet, mine. Today, we fulfil that.” 

She moved to the edge of the bed. 

“Your body belongs to me, Amy. Every part of it. I intend to take possession of it, including the parts no one has ever touched.”

Amy felt tears prick her eyes. This moment felt right. This moment was right.

She whispered, “Yes, Mistress.”

“I’m going to be gentle this time,” Anne said as she sat beside her, one hand coming to rest on Amy’s stomach. “Because I know it’s your first time, because I love you, and because you deserve to be cherished, even when I’m using my tart like she richly deserves – especially after that naughtiness she did with some rando at a petrol station on the way to lunch with her Mistress.” 

Anne’s hand slid lower. Their fingers intertwined.

“Yes, Mistress.” Amy’s voice was a whisper, and her cheeks felt positively nuclear as they came together.  “Please. I want… I want all of me to belong to you Mistress. Please, Mistress… I… I… I beg you … p-p-please… take me. Please… f-f-fuck… me…”

Anne leaned down and kissed her – deep and slow and thorough, a kiss that said mine in every movement. When she pulled back, her eyes were dark with something that made Amy’s heart flutter.

And Anne showed Amy what it felt to be utterly taken.

---

Later, Anne asked, “How do you feel, love?” as her fingers traced the gold collar, both basking in the gentle daze of afterglow.

Amy considered the question. She thought about the girl she had been eight months ago, that waitress at Marge’s Diner, the one who said “Miss” without knowing why, the one who had never understood the hunger that lived in her own bones.

That girl was gone.

In her place was a *woman.* 

To be sure, in many aspects, this new Amy was still quite girlish in her demeanour and manners; but the fulfilment, completeness, and maturity of her being today was much richer, beautiful, and cherished than she’d ever been.

“I feel…” Amy searched for the word. “I feel completed, Love. And I wonder how I was even functioning before. It’s like… Like everything I was before was… sketches of myself.”

Anne pressed a kiss to Amy’s forehead.

“You’ve grown a lot; and learned many things, Amy. It’s natural that you feel like that.”

“Anne, my love, my Mistress, don’t deny yourself the credit due to you. You took me under your wing and taught me to find myself. You unmade me, and remade me, as a stronger, better, more aware version of me. You… truly, truly saved me, Anne. And don’t say I also saved you, love. I know you too well. Saving me saved you.”

Outside, the sun was setting over the valley, painting the sky in shades of rose and gold. Inside, two women held each other, bound by metal and promises and the stubborn human need to belong.

Julia’s portrait watched from the wall, her painted eyes soft with something that in a living person might have been approval; and somewhere in the quiet of Anne’s heart – in the place where Julia’s voice had once argued, teased, and pushed – there was the silence of acceptance.

*Thank you,* Anne thought, though she wasn’t sure anymore whom was she thanking.

A new voice was starting to finish Anne’s thoughts – and it had Amy’s name in it.
