## Chapter Seven: The Becoming

The first days and weeks at Anne's were the hardest.

The training regimen wasn't the issue. Amy had expected that it would be difficult, and it was, in the way that learning any new skill was difficult. The kneeling positions, the protocols, the small rituals that structured their days... those were challenges that she could meet, with effort and attention.

What was hard about her new reality was the silence.

Amy had grown up surrounded by noise: the San Francisco apartment that had seen the first years of her life, with its thin walls and neighbours with even thinner patience; the clatter of the diner; and the constant hum of other people's lives pressing against her own.

Anne's house in St. Helena was almost aggressively quiet. The only sounds were birdsong, wind in the oaks, and the soft tick of the grandfather clock in the hallway.

In that silence, Amy could *hear* herself think. And thinking, she was discovering, was a treacherous road, which could very easily lead her down outright dangerous trains of thought.

*What are you **doing** here?* the thoughts would whisper, usually in the early morning when Anne was still asleep and Amy lay awake, feeling the leather collar against her throat. *You're playing house with a woman twice your age that you've known for three months. You've abandoned your degree, cut your family off, and upended your **life**... For what? For **this?***

*For this,* she would answer herself, reaching unconsciously to touch her collar. For its weight on her neck; for the way Anne seemed to look not so much *at* Amy, but *through* her, with those dark, penetrating eyes that dissected her the moment they set their intense gaze on her form, laying her bare in front of her Mistress. For the inner *peace* that washed over the young woman whenever she knelt.

But the self-doubt persisted, circling like a vulture at the edge of Amy's resolve, waiting for a sign of weakness.

---

"You're thinking too loudly," Anne said one morning, a week after Amy had moved in.

They were in the kitchen. Amy was making coffee — she had memorised how Anne liked it within the first two days, black and strong, served in the blue ceramic mug with the chipped handle that had been Julia's favourite — and Anne was watching her from the doorway, still in her robe, her dark hair loose around her shoulders.

"I'm sorry, Mistress?"

"Your shoulders are up around your ears. You're grinding your teeth so hard I can hear it, and you've been staring at that coffee pot like it owes you *money*." Anne crossed the kitchen and put her hands on Amy's shoulders, thumbs pressing into the knots of tension. "What's wrong, mine?"

Amy wanted to lie. She wanted to say *nothing, Mistress,* and smile, and be the perfect servant she was supposed to be. But Anne's rule one was to have no secrets, and Anne would know anyway. Anne always knew, God knows how, but she *knew*. So, Amy told the truth.

"I don't know what I'm supposed to *do* all day, Mistress."

Anne's hands stilled. "What do you mean?"

"I mean..." Amy paused and turned around, her hands resting on the edge of the counter. She was wearing the silk robe Anne had given her, firmly tied at the waist. It cinched her form attractively, and its length stopped just above the buttock curve, leaving a small part of it exposed. With a deep breath, the young woman said, "... At the diner, I had a purpose, Anne. I had tables to serve, orders to remember, people to take care of. Here..." Amy paused and thought a moment, realising how *vulnerable* she felt. "Here... I clean things that are already spotlessly clean. I cook meals that take an hour to make. I practice my positions..." She looked down at her hands, and closed them into light fists as she continued, "and then... I sit, and wait, and think... and the thinking... is not good."

"What do you think about, Amy? *Talk* to me. Please."

"Whether I belong here. Whether I'm good enough. Whether you'll get tired of me." Amy's voice cracked. "Whether I... whether I made a terrible mistake."

"Did you, Amy?"

"I... I don't know." The tears came before Amy could stop them. "I don't *know* anything anymore, Anne. I used to have a *plan*. I was going to finish my degree, get a job, live a normal life. And now I'm here, in this beautiful house, with this beautiful collar around my neck, and yet... I don't know who I *am* anymore."

Anne pulled her close. Amy buried her face in the warm cotton of Anne's robe and let herself cry — ugly, heaving sobs that shook her whole body. Anne held her through it, one hand stroking her hair, murmuring soft nonsense sounds that meant nothing and everything.

When the storm passed, Anne led Amy to the living room and sat her on the sofa. She then... changed. Her Dominant aura was all but gone. The *woman* came out. And Anne, the woman, *knelt* in front of Amy, and lovingly took her hands. It was a stunning reversal that made Amy's breath catch for a few moments. Never had she seen Anne so ... *fragile*.

"Amy... please listen to me carefully." Amy realised Anne's tone was much different than her usual, calm, confident voice. It was warm, small, and intimate. She was not hearing her Mistress, but the *woman* -- small, vulnerable, and *human*, all too human.

"What you're feeling... is normal. It has a name: transition shock. I lived it too, many years ago, before I was who I am now.

"When I was scarcely more than a teenager, my family was going through a hard time. I rebelled. I ran away, lived on the streets, and... did things I later came to regret.

"I pilfered the odd wallet, and gave the occasional 'service' to men, all for the thrill of the forbidden, all to feel **alive**. Then, one day, a man caught me red-handed as I was trying to steal his wallet. I had no need for the money, but I needed the *thrill*."

Amy shifted a little and looked at Anne intently as she paused and struggled with the recollection.

"When he grabbed my wrist with his hand, I froze and my heart stopped. I could have *sworn* he would have broken my wrist in two. But he... he looked at me... no... *through* me, and said, 'You, young lady, are in trouble. We can do this the official way... or we can do it *my* way. One destroys your life. The other doesn't. Choose.'"

Amy noticed Anne was struggling with this. Instinctively, without thinking, she reached and stroked Anne's hair as she paused and took a deep breath, steadying herself with a hand resting on her chest, as if to still her racing heart.

"That man... was Roger. My Master. He made me call my family, tell them what I had done, and then he said to them, 'I can help. Will you allow me to?' They said 'yes,' and the next day Roger made me his servant. It was not a choice, you see. It was that, or jail."

"Mistress... Anne... y-you don't have to..."

"I do," said Anne. "I *need* you to hear this, Amy. Please... bear with me for a bit more."

"I... never wore a permanent collar, like Julia did," Anne said, continuing her reveal. "But there was no question that I was, very much, Roger's servant. For five years, that man expected me to go straight to him after school. I had no liberty to do otherwise. My family knew I was being 'set straight' so they approved -- and *enforced* it."

Anne felt her eyes sting as tears welled unbidden.

"Roger tore me apart. His discipline was hard. For a week he gave me 20 paddle strikes, right here, on my butt, as soon as I entered his place, until I got it through my thick skull that as soon as I crossed his threshold, I was to strip to my underwear, wear a leather collar he had for me, and kneel to greet him: 'greetings, Master, this slave is ready to accept your training.'"

Anne breathed out, then in, then out again, trying to bring her anguish back to a more manageable state.

"About three weeks into his service, *everything* I had done up to then came tumbling down on me. The plight of my family; my running away from them; my *choice* to seek cheap thrills, which had ultimately led me to being Roger's servant until he deemed I was no longer a threat to myself or to others. That day... When I had properly greeted him... he bade me to get up. I tried, but couldn't do it."

Amy's head came close to Anne's. The two were facing each other, foreheads touching, sharing breath, and anguish.

"Please... Anne..."

Anne took Amy's hand and their fingers intertwined.

"The **weight** of my choices nailed me to the floor. It was too much at the same time, and I... I felt... much like you are feeling *right now*, Amy."

After a pause where Anne dried her eyes and breathed deeply to steady her racing heart, she continued, "Roger went for his paddle when he saw I was not standing on command. I knew I had messed up that day, and deserved to be paddled, but... but Roger dropped the paddle when he saw my face. He knelt, and held me, and said, 'Let it out, Anne.'"

"I... don't know how long I cried that day. When I realised it was over... the sun had set, and it was almost time to return to my family.

"Before I left that day, Roger said, 'Today was an important day, Anne. It will only get better moving forward.' And he was right. It got better.

"He went on to teach me *everything* I know about this lifestyle, and got me *hooked* on it. He never was sexual with me. That was not his goal. His goal was to fix me where I had gone awry, and turn me into someone useful to society. That... took five years, Amy. Five years of getting my ass paddled red, and failing, and stumbling, and learning, and doing it again, until Roger said 'Good, slave.'

"When he finally was happy with what I had become, he called me to him one day, unclasped the leather collar from my neck, and said, 'You're free now, Ms. Marquez. Your last, and only standing task remaining, is to pay it forward.'

"Months later, I entered medical school.

"So... just like I was told, when I was broken, and overwhelmed, and drowning in self doubt, I can tell you, Amy... Today was an *important* day for you. It'll take time, but it will get better moving forward."

Gently, slowly, Anne's Dominant aura came back, with a firmer, more authoritative voice, but still very much a reflection of Anne's *humanity.*

"Amy... I told you a very, very private part of me, so you *know* I **understand** the place where you are right now. Your brain is overwhelmed. You've made *enormous* changes to your life in a *very* short time. You've left your job and your home, and you *cut* your family out of your life. You've entered a new relationship, a new dynamic, a new *you*. Your brain is trying to catch up, and it's frightened, and frightened brains lie to us, to protect themselves."

"What kind of lies?"

"That we don't belong. That we're not good enough. That *everything* we've built will crumble if we look at it sideways." Anne squeezed Amy's hands ever so gently. "I heard those lies for two years after Julia died. They told me that I would never love, have a servant, or *feel* again.

"They were *wrong*."

Amy sniffled. "How did you make them stop? How did you *silence* them, Mistress?"

"Those lies never stop, Amy. They get softer, or louder, but they never fall silent. What I did was, I *refused* to believe them." Anne smiled, soft and sad. "It takes time, practice... and purpose.

"You are absolutely right, Amy. You *need* something to do, something that's yours, that gives you a *reason* to get up in the morning, something larger than yourself, something that goes *beyond* waiting for me to come home."

"Like what, Mistress?"

Anne was quiet for a moment, her dark eyes thoughtful. Then she said, "What were you studying at Berkeley?"

"Art history. With a minor in studio practice."

"Did you enjoy that?"

Amy considered the question. "I loved to *understand* a canvas. I loved standing in front of a painting and trying to figure out what the artist was seeing and *feeling.* I loved the way art could make me give form to emotions I didn't have words for.

"The academic part was harder. It felt like I was being made to dissect something that was alive to me."

"What about the creative side, the studio practice?"

"I..." Amy trailed off. She had almost forgotten. "I used to draw when I was younger. I liked to draw faces, mostly. I would sit in cafés and sketch the people around me, trying to capture something true about them." She looked down at her hands, then softly said, "I stopped when I started college. There wasn't time, and it seemed... frivolous... and... and childish."

"Show me."

"I don't have any of my old sketchbooks. They're in storage in San Francisco, with everything else I couldn't fit in my uncle's house."

"Then you should start new ones." Anne stood, pulling Amy up with her. "Come with me."

---

The art supply store in downtown St. Helena was small but well-stocked, catering to the wine country tourists who fancied themselves painters after a few glasses of Cabernet. Anne walked besides Amy through the aisles, watching her face as she touched the paper, the pencils, the charcoals and pastels in their neat wooden boxes. The contact with the world of tempera, gouache, pastels, charcoal, pencils, canvas and paper seemed to brighten Amy's face to a younger version of herself, delighted in the sensorial exploration of all that media and materials.

"Choose whatever calls to you," Anne said.

Amy hesitated.

"Mistress, these are expensive—"

"I didn't say 'choose whatever's cheapest,' Amy. I said, 'choose whatever calls to you,' didn't I?"

"... You did say that, Mistress."

"So, choose."

Amy chose a large sketchbook with heavy, cream-coloured paper, a set of graphite pencils ranging from 6H to 8B, charcoal sticks, both vine and compressed, and a kneaded eraser that felt like putty in her hands. She also chose a portable easel that folded flat for carrying.

At the register, the total made Amy wince, but Anne handed over her card without flinching.

"Now," Anne said as they walked back to the car, "you have tools. I suggest you start using them, mine."

---

Amy started drawing that afternoon.

She set up the easel in the living room, facing the large windows that looked out over the valley, and began with what was in front of her: the view. The rolling hills, the rows of grapevines, the distant mountains blue with haze. Her hand was rusty at first, the lines uncertain, but muscle memory returned quickly. By the time Anne came home from her afternoon house calls, Amy had filled three pages.

"May I see?" Anne asked.

Amy showed her. Anne studied each drawing carefully, taking her time, treating them with the seriousness they deserved.

"These are good," she said finally. "You have a real eye for composition. But they're safe."

"Safe?"

"Landscapes are easy. They don't look back at you. They don't challenge you." Anne set the sketchbook down. "Tomorrow, I want you to draw something harder."

"Like what?"

Anne smiled, and there was something in that smile that made Amy's stomach flutter. "We'll see."

---

The next morning, Anne woke Amy early.

"Get up, pet. We're going to try something new."

Amy followed Anne to the living room, still fuzzy with sleep. The curtains were drawn, and Anne had set up a single lamp in the corner, its light soft and golden. In the centre of the room, she had placed the armchair from her study, angled to catch the light.

"Sit," Anne said, gesturing to the chair.

Amy sat, confused. Anne circled her slowly, studying her the way she might study a patient.

"Take off your robe, mine."

Amy's hands went to the sash automatically, then stopped. She was wearing nothing underneath the robe. Anne had been gradually reducing her sleepwear over the past week, from pyjamas to a nightgown to underwear to just the robe, and the thought of sitting in the nude in this staged, deliberate way made her skin prickle with anxiety.

"Mistress, I..."

"I know." Anne's voice was gentle, but unquestionable in her authority. "That's why we're doing this. Take off your robe, pet."

Amy untied the sash. Her hands were trembling. She let the silk slide off her shoulders, pool around her waist, and then, with an effort that felt enormous, she stood, let it fall to the floor, and sat back down.

For the first time, Amy was naked for her Mistress, under the lamplight, and Anne was *looking* at her -- not with desire, though that was there too, tightly coiled and restrained, lurking under the surface like a snake ready to strike. Anne was looking at her the way she had looked at the sketchbook: carefully, thoroughly, with focussed attention.

"You're beautiful," Anne said.

Amy made a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob. "I'm not—"

"Don't." Anne's voice sharpened. "Don't argue with *me* about what I can *see* with my own eyes. You are beautiful, Amy, and... you're going to learn to see it."

Anne retrieved Amy's sketchbook and pencils. She pressed them into Amy's hands and said, "draw yourself."

Amy stared at her. "What?"

"There's a mirror in the hallway. I'm going to bring it in here and set it up in front of you You, my beautiful, shy girl, are going to draw what you see." Anne held her gaze on Amy, becoming intensely earnest in her words. "I do not want you to draw what you think you should see; nor do I want you to render what you're afraid you'll see. I *want* what's actually **there.**"

"I... I *can't*..."

"You can. And you will."

Anne then touched Amy's cheek, her thumb brushing away a tear she hadn't realised she'd shed.

"This is training, for both your body and mind. You've spent your whole life hiding from yourself. Today... we start to change that. Together."

---

The mirror cast back to Amy the image of a naked, young woman, her honey-blonde hair loose around her shoulders. Her milky-fair skin was marked with the faint pink of a blush that spread from her cheeks and down her throat to her chest. She had small, B-cup breasts, high and firm, their nipples a darker, redder shade of rose against the surrounding, fair skin. Her belly had a soft, barely perceptible curve to it. Her Venus gap was hidden, as her thighs were tightly pressed together in instinctive modesty. Her pubic hair was a darker, browner shade of blonde, and peeked out from the joined legs. The black leather collar at her throat starkly popped out in contrast against the fairness of her features.

*That's me*, Amy thought. *That's what I look like.*

She had avoided mirrors for years. She was perfectly comfortable in giving a quick glance at herself to check her hair or makeup, but she had never, ever dared to really *look* at herself. She didn't want to confront the body she inhabited. But Anne was watching, and expected her to draw *herself*.

Amy had promised her she'd obey.

So, she picked up a pencil, and began to draw.

---

Her first attempt was terrible.

Amy's hand kept flinching away from the truth, softening the lines, avoiding little unflattering details.

When she was done, Anne looked at the draft, shook her head, tore the page out and crumpled it.

"Again, pet."

The second attempt was worse. Amy overcompensated almost to a hyper-realistic extreme, almost to the point of making herself uglier than she was, punishing the image for existing.

When Anne saw the draft, she frowned, shook her head, tore the page out, and crumpled it.

"Again, mine."

At the third attempt, Amy stopped fighting herself, and gave her hand the freedom to move, following what her eyes saw.

She drew the curve of her shoulder, the hollow of her collarbone, the gentle swell of her perky breasts.

She drew the small mole beneath her left nipple that she had always hated.

She drew her thighs, full and well-formed; her knees; and the delicate bones of her feet.

She drew her face: the uncertainty in her eyes, the nervousness in her mind frozen in an anxious, endearing lip bite, and the fear and determination in her eyes, fighting for dominance.

When she finished, hours had passed. Her hand was cramped, and her back ached from holding still. On the page, though, there was a *woman.* She was not just beautiful -- she also was *there,* human, present.

Amy handed over the sketchbook.

Anne studied the drawing for a long time. This time, her hand did not reach to tear the page. "This," she said finally, "is a beginning."

---

The body work continued over the following days.

Each morning, Anne would have Amy pose in a different way: standing, kneeling, lying on her side.

Amy would draw herself, with Anne watching, and gradually — so gradually that Amy almost didn't notice it happening — the shame began to recede.

It didn't fully disappear. It was still there, lurking around the outer rim of Amy's conscious mind, always ready to spread its familiar poison once more. The exposure, though, made it quieter, easier to ignore... which made other things grow louder -- the pride she felt when Anne praised a drawing; the peace that settled over her when she knelt for her; the warmth that spread through her chest when she heard Anne's car in the driveway, or when she hurried to her position by the door, and awaited for her Mistress to come home.

The greeting ritual was Amy's favourite part of the day.

Ten minutes before Anne was due to arrive, Amy would kneel in the entryway, wearing nothing but her collar, proudly on display on her throat, on the present position Anne had first taught her.

Amy would breathe slowly, letting the anticipation build, letting her mind empty of everything except for the waiting, the wanting, the absolute certainty that Anne would walk through that door and find her exactly where she was supposed to be.

When the door opened, Amy would lower her eyes and say, "Good evening, Mistress. I hope your day was serene and productive. Your pet Amy welcomes you home." Then... she would bend forward and kiss Anne's left foot.

The first time she'd performed that ritual, she had blushed so hard she felt faint. The act had seemed absurd, degrading, *ridiculous* — a grown woman, kissing another grown woman's foot like a supplicant before a queen? *Preposterous.*

But Anne's hand had come down to stroke her hair, and had said, "Good girl. I'm happy to be home."

And Amy had understood.

The ritual was not about degradation at all.

It was about *devotion*.

It was a gift freely given, and received with gratitude -- A moment in time that said: *I am yours. I have been waiting for you. You are the centre of my world.*

By the end of the second week, Amy craved it like air.

---

On the sixteenth day, Anne took Amy to San Francisco.

"There's an exhibition at the de Young," Anne said over breakfast. "It's about nineteenth-century French painting. I think you should see it."

Amy could not say "Yes!" fast enough.

They drove down together, Anne's blue Mercedes eating up the miles of Highway 101. Amy wore a simple sundress, with nothing underneath — Anne had forbidden her from wearing undergarments, so that Amy was acutely aware that she was not really *dressed,* but merely *clothed.* The collar, though, stayed hidden beneath a silk scarf.

Amy watched the landscape change from vineyard to suburb to city. She wiggled nervously, embarrassment and excitement vying for dominance over her emotional state.

When they got there, the museum was cool and quiet, its galleries hushed with the particular reverence that art demanded. Anne led Amy through the rooms, past Impressionist landscapes and portraits of socialites, until they reached a smaller gallery at the back.

"Here we are," Anne said.

The paintings in this room were different. They all portrayed women in various states of undress, lounging on divans, bathing in copper tubs, sleeping in rumpled beds. The style ranged from classical to provocative, but they all shared a common quality: the women in them seemed utterly at ease in their bodies.

Amy stood in front of one painting for a long time. It showed a woman reclining on a velvet chaise, her body turned toward the viewer, one arm draped behind her head. She was not thin — her belly curved softly, her thighs were full, and her cleavage suggested buxom breasts — but she was *present* in a way that made Amy's breath catch. She inhabited her body completely. She had nothing to hide.

"This painting was made by Carolus-Duran in the 1870s. The model was probably a prostitute. In that era, only women of that profession would pose nude."

"She looks so... peaceful..."

"She looks like she knows something, doesn't she, mine?" Anne said as she moved to stand behind Amy, close enough that she could feel her Mistress's warmth. "What do you think she knows?"

Amy considered. "That she's beautiful?"

"Maybe. What else?"

"That... that her body isn't something to be ashamed of. That it's worthy of being seen. Worthy of being..." Amy searched for the word. "... *celebrated*."

"Yes." Anne's hand came to rest on the small of Amy's back. "That's what I want you to know, pet. That's what we've been working toward. Your body isn't something to hide from. It's something to honour, to inhabit fully, to offer completely, when, where and to whomever you choose, as a present."

Amy felt tears prick her eyes. She blinked them back, keeping her gaze on the painting.

"I'm trying, Mistress."

"I know you are. And you're making progress." Anne's hand moved in slow circles. "The first day I asked you to undress, you couldn't look at yourself. Remember? You couldn't sit still. You drew yourself like a punishment."

"I remember."

"This morning, you knelt for me without a trace of shame. You met my eyes. You smiled." Anne leaned closer, her lips brushing Amy's ear. "You're becoming who you were meant to be, mine. It just takes time."

---

That evening, back in St. Helena, Amy asked to draw Anne.

It was the first time she had asked for anything during her training. Before, Anne had directed, and Amy had followed. But the paintings at the museum had stirred something in the young woman, a hunger to create, to capture, to give *something* instead of only just *receiving*.

Anne considered the request. Then she smiled.

"Yes," she said. "You may draw me."

Anne sat on the armchair where Amy had first confronted her own reflection. Then, with a calm, gentle gesture, she loosened her robe, uncovering herself to Amy for the first time. The pose she chose was almost academic: hands on her lap, legs crossed, dark hair tumbling over one shoulder. The loose robe covered the more intimate parts, but left everything else in view. Her expression was calm, imperious, utterly *Anne* — the physician, the Dominant, the woman who had pulled Amy from the wreckage of her life and offered her something better.

Amy drew for two hours.

She drew the lines at the corners of Anne's eyes — lines of laughter, of grief, of years lived fully. She drew the elegant bones of her face, the curve of her throat, the strength in her hands. She drew the way the lamplight fell across her skin, the shadow beneath her collarbone, the swell of her breasts, and the hint of softness at her belly that spoke of age, comfort, and a body that had learned to accept itself.

When she finished, Amy was practically shaking with the fierce, bright energy of creative oestrus. She had made something *real*.

"May I see?" Anne asked.

Amy handed over the sketchbook.

Anne looked at the drawing for a long time. Her expression shifted and her eyes moistened.

"Is this how you see me?" she asked.

"Yes, Mistress."

Anne intently looked at the sketchbook, almost as if she were memorising every line and shade of that drawing. Then, she set the sketchbook down, walked up to Amy, and pulled her into a kiss so intense, deep and thorough that Amy forgot how to breathe.

"Thank you," Anne whispered against her lips. "This is the most beautiful gift anyone has ever given me."

---

That night, Anne took Amy to bed.

It was not the first time by far, since they had been sleeping in the same bed since Amy moved in, their bodies curled around each other in the dark. But tonight was different. Tonight, Anne had purpose in her eyes.

"Lie down on your back, mine."

Amy obeyed, her heart already quickening. She was naked, having grown finally comfortable with it, but this felt *different.*

Anne was looking at her with that clinical attention she usually reserved for patients once again.

"Tonight," Anne said, settling beside her, "we begin a different kind of training."

"Mistress?"

"You've learned to see and *accept* your body without reeling at its sight." Anne's hand came to rest on Amy's sternum, warm and still. "Now, you need to learn to *feel* it. To understand what it wants, what it responds to, what makes it sing — and what leaves it silent."

Amy swallowed. "I... I don't know much about... I mean, I've touched myself, Mistress, b-but—"

"Shh." Anne's thumb traced a slow circle on Amy's skin. "That's why we're doing this. I'm going to touch you everywhere, mine. And you're going to tell me what you feel. Not what you think you *should* feel, or what you think I want to hear. I want the truth. Always, *only* the truth."

"Yes, Mistress."

Anne began with Amy's face. Her fingertips traced Amy's eyebrows, the bridge of her nose, the curve of her cheekbones. She was clinical and methodical about it, as if she was mapping unknown territory.

"How does this feel?"

"It feels... Nice. Gentle. It's like... like being looked at, but with hands."

Anne's fingers moved to Amy's lips, tracing the cupid's bow and the fullness of the lower lip. Amy's breath caught.

"And this?"

"More... more *present*. I can feel my heartbeat in my lips."

"Good." Anne's hand drifted lower, to Amy's throat, encircling it loosely — not squeezing, just *holding*. "And this?"

Amy's eyes fluttered closed. "I... that's... that's *different*."

"Different how?"

"It makes me feel... s-small... a-and helpless... like... like you could do anything, a-and I couldn't stop you." Amy's voice dropped to a whisper. "I... I l-like it."

Anne filed that away. Her hand moved on, to Amy's shoulders, her collarbones, the soft skin of her upper chest. She catalogued Amy's responses: the slight shivers, the changes in breathing, the moments when Amy's body leaned into the touch versus the moments when it merely accepted it.

"Your body is an instrument," Anne said, her fingers circling Amy's breast without touching the nipple. "Every part of it has its own voice. Some parts whisper. Some parts sing. And some parts..." Her thumb brushed across Amy's nipple, and she gasped. "...some parts *scream*."

"Mistress—"

"Tell me."

"It's... it's like electricity. But not just there. It goes... *down*."

"Where?"

Amy blushed, even now, even after weeks of mirror work and nude kneeling. "My... between my legs."

"Say it properly, mine. You need to be able to name your own body."

"I-it... it g-goes... straight... s-straight d-down... t-to... to my... my p-pussy, Mistress."

"Good girl." Anne's fingers continued their slow exploration, mapping Amy's ribs, belly, and the soft curve below her navel. She paused at the crease where Amy's thigh met her hip. "This is one of the most sensitive places on a woman's body. Most people don't know that."

She stroked along the crease, light as breath, and Amy whimpered.

"What do you feel, pet?"

"Like... like I want you to go further. But also like I want you to stay right there... f-forever..."

"That's called *anticipation*, pet. It's one of the most powerful tools in erotic play. The wanting. The waiting. The almost." Anne's fingers moved to Amy's inner thigh, drawing slow spirals. "Sometimes the almost is better than the having."

Amy was trembling now, her hands fisted in the sheets. "Mistress, I... I need..."

"What do you need?"

"Ah... I, I don't... I don't *know*. I just... I feel like I'm about to... to fly... a-apart."

Anne leaned down and pressed a kiss to Amy's forehead. "That's arousal, pet. Real arousal, not the quick, guilty kind you gave yourself in the dark. This is what it feels like when someone takes their time with you."

She moved her hand away from Amy's thigh, and even as she made a sound of protest Anne placed her hand flat on Amy's belly.

"Now... I'm going to ask you some questions, and I want honest answers. Not what you think a good servant should say. I want what felt *true* to you."

"Y-yes, Mistress."

"When I touched your throat, did that frighten you, or excite you?"

"... B-both, Mistress. But... but it e-excited me... m-more..."

"When I touched your nipple, did it feel like it was too much, too little, or just right?"

Amy considered. "Maybe... a little too light, Mistress... I... I wanted... I needed... m-more."

"Harder touch? Or more time?"

"Both, I think, Mistress."

Anne nodded, storing the information. "What about your inner thigh? Did you want me to move inward, or were you content with where I was?"

"I wanted... I wanted you to ... to... t-to touch my... m-my.... my p-p-pussy... But I was also scared."

"Scared of what?"

Amy was quiet for a moment. "I... I was... S-scared of what I might feel. Scared of it being too much. Terrified about me being... y-you know... too... n-needy, too..." She struggled for the word. "...too *h-h-hungry*."

Anne's expression softened into the kindest smile. She said, in an infinitely soft, maternal tone, "Amy... Amy, Look at me, pet."

Amy opened her eyes.

"Your hunger is not a flaw. It's not something to be ashamed of. It's a gift to *yourself,* and to whoever is fortunate enough to receive it."

Anne's hand moved up to cup Amy's face. "I *want* you to be hungry. I want you to want things, and ask for them, and *allow* yourself to have them. That's what this training is for. To make you *whole*."

Amy felt tears prick her eyes. "I... I d-don't know how to want things, Mistress. I spent my whole life trying not to want."

"I know, pet. That's why we're going slowly. That's why tonight was about discovery, not satisfaction." Anne kissed her gently. "We have time. We have all the time in the world."

---

Afterwards, the women lay together, Amy's head on Anne's shoulder, Anne's fingers tracing idle patterns on Amy's arm.

"Mistress?"

"Yes, pet?"

"What about you?"

"What about me?"

Amy hesitated. "What... what do you like? What makes you feel the way I felt tonight?"

Anne was quiet for a moment. When she spoke, her voice was thoughtful.

"I like to *be* in control. That won't surprise you. I like knowing that someone has given themselves to me, completely, without reservation." Her fingers stilled. "But there's more to it than that. I like... I like to *shape* a person. I enjoy taking someone apart slowly, learn what makes them weak on their legs, what makes them tremble and gasp, and then putting them back together in a way that makes them stronger. That's what arouses me more than any touch."

"So... tonight was... for you too?"

"Very much so." Anne pressed a kiss to Amy's hair. "Watching you learn your own body, hearing you name what you feel, seeing you starting to understand what you want? That was more erotic to me than anything we could have done with hands, mouths -- or toys."

Amy considered this. "So... your pleasure comes from *my* pleasure?"

"In part. But also from the whole *process* of teaching and shaping you." Anne's voice dropped lower. "When you finally beg me to take you carnally, it won't just be about the physical act of claiming you, mine. It will be about everything we've built to get there: every lesson, every discovery, and every moment of trust."

Amy shivered. "I want that, Mistress. I want to be ready for you."

"In time, you will be, pet."

They lay in silence for a while, breathing together, heartbeats slowly synchronizing.

"Mistress?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you... for being patient with me."

Anne's arm tightened around her. "Thank you, Amy, for being worth the patience."

---

The weeks settled into a steady, soothing rhythm.

Each morning, Amy woke before Anne and made coffee. She knelt, nude, to present it — a ritual Anne had instituted in the second week, one that Amy had grown to love. The cold floor against her knees, the warmth of the mug in her hands, the sleepy gratitude in Anne's eyes as she accepted the offering.

Training came soon after coffee. Positions and protocols were reinforced daily -- and there were also lessons about the thousand small rituals that structured a servant's day.

Amy was a quick study, and Anne was a patient teacher. Gradually, what had once felt awkward became natural, instinctive, *right*.

After training, Anne would leave for her house calls, and Amy would have the day to herself.

She drew constantly. Her sketches included many subjects: the view from the windows, the flowers in Julia's garden that Amy had begun, tentatively, to tend, and the cats that Anne had rescued: Shadow, a black tom with one torn ear, and Tiger, a marmalade tabby missing half her tail.

She drew herself, too, whenever the old shame whispered too loudly. She would set up the mirror and look, really look, until the whispers quieted.

She also started to "talk" to Julia.

It had started by accident.

Amy had been cleaning Anne's closet, handling the garment bags with careful reverence, when she had found herself speaking aloud.

"I hope you don't mind me being here," she had said to the empty room. "I know I'm not you. I know I can never replace what you had with her. But I promise I'll take care of her. I promise I'll try to make her happy."

There had been no answer, of course. Julia was dead, her ashes scattered in the valley she had loved. But Amy had felt something, a sense of having been *heard*.

After that, she "talked" to Julia more often. Not every day, but when the mood struck — particularly whenever she was uncertain, lonely, or overwhelmed by the strangeness of her new life.

"She misses you," Amy said one afternoon, sitting cross-legged on the closet floor, the rosewood box in her lap. "She tries to hide it, but I can tell. Sometimes she looks at me and I know she's seeing you. I don't mind. I think it means she has room in her heart for both of us."

She traced the lid of the box with her fingertip.

"I hope I'm doing this right. I hope you'd approve. She says you would have liked me, but how could she know? You were you, and I'm just... me, an accidental waitress from a diner who didn't know what she was until your Mistress showed her."

A breeze came through the window, stirring the garment bags. Amy smiled.

"I'll take that as a yes."

---

At the end of the third week, Anne sat Amy down for a conversation.

"We need to talk about your future, mine."

Amy felt a flutter of panic. "Have I done something wrong, Mistress?"

"No. Quite the opposite." Anne took her hand. "You've thrived here. Your drawings have become remarkable, and your service is impeccable. You've embraced your training with more grace than I could have hoped for."

"Then... why...?"

"Because *this* isn't enough for you."

Anne's voice was gentle but firm.

"You need more than just being my servant, Amy. You need something that's *yours*. A purpose. A direction. A *life* outside these walls."

"I *have* a life, Mistress. I... I have *you!*"

"And you always *will* have me, mine. But I'm forty-one years old, pet. I have a career, colleagues, and decades of experience to draw on. You're twenty-four. You have your whole life ahead of you, and I won't let you spend it just waiting for me to come home. It isn't *fair,* and it doesn't let you *be* your best you."

Amy wanted to argue. She wanted to say that waiting for Anne to come home was all she needed, that serving her was enough, that she had never been happier than she was right now.

But deep down, Amy knew.

Anne was right.

She had felt it herself, in the early days — the restlessness, the doubt, the sense of being adrift...

Drawing had helped, giving her something to *do*, but drawing for the sake of drawing wasn't a future. It was... a distraction, a hobby, not a *future.*

"... W-what do you want me to do, Mistress?" she asked.

"I want you to think about going back to school."

Amy blinked. "School?"

"Not necessarily to Berkeley. There are excellent art programmes closer to home — Sonoma State, UC Davis... heck, even Napa Valley College has a strong studio programme."

Anne squeezed Amy's hand.

"You have *talent,* Amy. *Real* talent. Without proper training, though, talent does not become anything. It stays cocooned as just... a potential. I want to help you become the best version of you."

"Me... an artist?"

"Yes, if that's what you want. Or you could be an art historian, a teacher, or something else entirely. That's the whole point, mine. It has to be *your* choice, *your* path. I can support and guide you; I can even point you to your path... but I can't walk it for you, pet."

Amy was quiet for a long moment. She thought about the sketchbook full of drawings, the hours spent in front of the mirror learning to see herself, and about those nudes she had seen at the museum, where the models seemed so utterly at home in their own skin.

"Can I think about it?" she asked.

"Of course. Take all the time you need."

---

Amy thought about it for a week.

She researched programmes, read course catalogues, and looked at the work of artists she admired. She also "talked" to Julia about it, alone in the closet with the garment bags and the rosewood box.

"What do you think?" she asked. "Should I do it? Should I go back to school and try to be a real artist? Or is that just... ego? Would I be pretending I'm something I'm not?"

The garment bags rustled. A beam of sunlight fell across the floor, warming Amy's bare feet.

"You're not being helpful, you know," Amy said, pouting, but then she smiled.

That night, she knelt before Anne and made her request.

"I... I want to apply to Sonoma State, Mistress. They have a studio art programme with a focus on drawing and painting. It's only forty-five minutes from here, so I could commute. I could still be here to serve you, and... and still be yours. If you'll allow it."

Anne looked at her for a long time. Her expression was unreadable.

"You're asking my permission?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"Why?"

"Because you're my Mistress. Because my life is yours to direct. Because I..." Amy faltered. "Because I need to know that you approve. That you want this for me. That it's not just... running away."

Anne reached out and touched Amy's face. Her thumb traced the line of her cheekbone and the curve of her lip. Her eyes were moist with unshed tears.

"I'm so proud of you, pet," she said softly. "You have no idea how proud I am."

"Is that a yes?"

Anne laughed as tears streamed from her eyes. It was a heartfelt laugh, warm and bright. "Yes, Amy. That's a yes."

---

That night, the valley stretched without, dark and quiet under a sky full of stars. Within, two women held each other, breathing in unison, heartbeats slowly synchronising after another time spent exploring each other's sensations.

Amy's eyes were closed. The collar was warm against her throat, and her body still hummed with the echoes of Anne's gentle touching. It still wasn't sexual interplay, but the sessions took Amy to a *heightened* kind of awareness. She had become *aware* of her own body in ways she hadn't been before.

She understood now what Anne meant about anticipation. About the "almost" being better than the "having."

She wasn't ready yet. But she was *becoming* ready.

And that, she was learning, was its own kind of pleasure.

---

In the morning, Amy woke before dawn.

She slipped out of bed, careful not to disturb Anne, who was still deeply asleep, and padded naked to the living room.

The day's first light was just beginning to touch the hills, painting them in shades of rose and gold.

Amy set up her easel, and retrieved her sketchbook, pencils and charcoals.

Then... she drew.

The outline taking shape in the blank surface, though, was not hers or Anne's, and it wasn't a vista of the valley; nor was it a sumi-e style drawing of their cats, or a sketch of the flowers once again blooming in Julia's garden.

Amy drew a woman she had never met.

It was a woman with flowing red hair, sharp eyes, and a smile that suggested she knew secrets no one else did.

She drew her from imagination, Anne's stories, the photographs on the mantle, and the love letters Amy had found, tucked away in a drawer, written in a hand that had been steady at first and hesitant and shaky toward the end.

She drew Julia.

When Anne woke and found her, Amy was crying as the drawing was being finished. Her quiet, silent tears fell onto the paper, smudging the charcoal and adding their own marks to the portrait.

Anne stopped dead in her tracks and looked at the drawing for a long time, tears filling her eyes with renewed grief -- and solace.

"Oh... Amy..." she said, oh so softly, her voice broken with emotion. "You've captured her perfectly."

Amy jumped and turned, nearly ruining the drawing in the process.

"Mistress! I... f-forgive me, you startled me..."

Anne walked over to where Amy was.

"May I see it?" she asked.

"O-of course, Mistress, i-it is for you, after all."

As Anne observed Amy's rendition of Julia, Amy rushed to explain herself. "I... I wanted you to have... something from me... Something that showed... I... I understand."

When Anne finished looking at Julia's drawing, her smile was unlike any that the young woman had ever seen adorn her Mistress's face.

Without a word, Anne came close and pulled Amy into a tight, loving, maternal, heartfelt hug. They stood together like that for a long while in the morning light, three women, two living and one remembered, bound together by love, loss and the stubborn human insistence on connection.

"Julia would be so pleased, pet. I... am so thankful for this gift. I will treasure it."

And somewhere, Amy was certain, Julia was smiling.
