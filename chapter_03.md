## Chapter Three: The Broken Car

The Mercedes had been making a halting noise for the past three days.

It was subtle at first, a faint hiccup from somewhere deep in the engine bay that Anne could almost convince herself she was imagining. By the second day it had become a hesitation when idling, a slight roughness when she shifted gears, a sluggishness when she pressed on the accelerator. By the third day, Anne knew she was on borrowed time.

She should have taken the car to the trusted shop she had always taken it. There, the mechanics specialised in classics and understood that a 1970 300 SEL was not merely a means of transportation but a piece of history, a connection to something irreplaceable. The shop, however, would take several days to repair the car, and Anne found herself unwilling to be without her classic for that long.

It was not the inconvenience that troubled her. She had other vehicles — a practical Volvo estate for house calls on rough roads she could not possibly take her classic through, and a soft-top BMW convertible she almost never drove.

That blue Mercedes was not about practicality.

It was about holding on to things that mattered, even when the world insisted they should be let go.

And, if she was being honest with herself, that Mercedes was also about Marge's Diner, the route that took her past it twice a day, and about that girl who worked there, whose smile made Anne feel something she had thought herself incapable of feeling ever again.

It was nearly nine in the evening when the classic's engine finally gave up.

Anne had just dropped Amy at her house in Yountville. It was the fourth time this week, and those rides had become a quiet ritual neither of them acknowledged. Anne was backing out of the driveway when the Mercedes shuddered, coughed twice, and died.

She tried the ignition. Nothing. With a heavy sigh, she tried again. The starter clicked and the engine turned over, but it would not come to life.

"Damn," Anne muttered, and then, because she was alone and the night was dark and the universe seemed to be conspiring against her in ways both large and small, she added a salty phrase that would have made her father raise an eyebrow in disapproval and her mother blush.

She sighed a deep, frustrated sigh and sat in the silent car for a long moment, staring at the dark house where Amy had disappeared into, her hands resting on the steering wheel. The porch light was still off. The only illumination came from that same side window, the yellow glow of a lamp left burning against the night.

Anne could call a tow truck. She could call a taxi. She could call any number of people who would come and rescue her from this minor automotive catastrophe.

And, as the Fates would have it, Anne's phone, too, conspired against her, deciding that there was not enough coverage at that moment for her to place any calls.

And so it was that that night Anne found herself humbly walking up the cracked concrete path that led to Amy's front door.

---

Amy answered on the second knock, still wearing her work clothes, her honey-blonde hair loose around her shoulders. Her eyes widened when she saw Anne standing on her doorstep.

"Miss Anne? Is everything—"

She looked past Anne to the Mercedes, sitting dark and silent in the driveway. "Oh no. Did it...?"

"It did," Anne said, managing a meek, rueful smile. "And, to top it all off, my phone mocks me by denying me service when I need it the most. I apologise for the intrusion. I was wondering if I might use your phone to call for a tow?"

"At this hour?" Amy said. "They'll charge you a fortune!"

Amy stepped back, holding the door open. "Please, come in. I know someone who might be able to help — he's not a mechanic per se, but he knows his way around old cars. He won't charge you half a year's salary, either."

Anne hesitated on the threshold. She was acutely aware that crossing it would move them from the neutral territory of diners and car rides into something far more intimate. This was Amy's space, Amy's *life* that she was stepping into.

"I don't want to impose," Anne said.

"You're not imposing." Amy's voice was soft but certain. "Please, come in, Miss Anne."

Anne stepped inside.

---

The house was smaller than it had appeared from the outside, or perhaps it only felt that way because of what filled it. Boxes were stacked along one wall, some opened and half-unpacked, others still sealed with packing tape and marked in faded handwriting. The furniture was old but good quality — a worn leather sofa, an oak coffee table with water rings from decades of use, bookshelves filled with volumes that looked as if they had been read and reread until their spines cracked.

"I'm sorry about the mess," Amy said, moving ahead of Anne to clear a stack of papers from the sofa. "I keep meaning to finish unpacking, but every time I start I get... distracted."

"By what?"

Amy paused, a stack of old magazines in her hands. "By him, I suppose. My uncle. Every box I open, I find something of his, and then I start remembering, and then..." She shrugged, a small, helpless gesture. "It's hard to let go."

"Yes," Anne said quietly. "It is."

She looked around the room with a physician's eye for detail. One immediately caught her attention: a Poul Henningsen Artichoke lamp hung from the ceiling. Unless she was very wrong about it, it was an original, and worth more than everything else in the room combined.

The photographs on the mantle were faded images of a man she assumed was Amy's uncle at various ages, sometimes alone, sometimes with family members whose faces she did not recognise. A half-empty bottle of wine stood on the kitchen counter, its cork awkwardly pushed back in at an angle.

And there was Amy herself, standing in the middle of it all, still holding that stack of magazines, as if she had forgotten what she meant to do with them.

"The lamp," Anne said. "Is that a genuine Poul Henningsen?"

Amy looked up at it, surprised. "I... I don't know, actually. It was my uncle's. He never said where he got it."

"If it's authentic, it's worth quite a lot of money."

"Really?" Amy looked at the lamp with new eyes, then shook her head. "Ah... I c-couldn't sell it. It was his. It would feel like..." She trailed off, unable to find the right word.

"Like letting go," Anne supplied.

"Yes," Amy said, meeting her eyes, then concluded, "exactly like that."

---

The phone call to Joe Hampton was brief. Amy explained the situation, gave him the address, and listened for a moment before thanking him and hanging up.

"He'll come by tomorrow around noon," she said. "He thinks it might be the fuel pump, but he won't know until he looks at it." She hesitated. "He said... he said you shouldn't try to start it again tonight. Something about flooding the engine."

"Sound advice." Anne looked out the window at the Mercedes, a dark shape in the deeper darkness. "I should call a taxi and get out of your hair. It's late for you, isn't it?"

"At this hour? No way. The nearest taxi company is up in Napa. It would take them forty minutes just to get here, and then another forty to get you home." Amy then bit her lip and against her better judgment found herself saying, "Miss Anne? I... I have a couch where you could sleep in tonight. It's not much, but it's comfortable... a-and I have spare blankets."

Anne should have refused. She knew she should have refused. Every *sensible* instinct she possessed was screaming at her to keep her distance and contain their relationship to coffee, car rides and the safe, neutral space of public interaction.

But Amy was looking at her with those spring-sky eyes, and the house was warm, and outside the night was dark and cold, and Anne was so... so very *tired* of being *sensible*.

"... I don't want to be any trouble," she said.

"You're not trouble, Miss Anne." Amy smiled, and something in Anne's chest turned over. Then, she felt butterflies in her stomach when Amy said, in a very small voice, so softly that it was hard to hear, "You're never any trouble."

---

"Have you eaten, Miss Anne?"

The question caught Anne off guard. She had been standing by the window, looking out at the Mercedes, lost in thought. When she turned, Amy was in the kitchen doorway, an apron tied around her waist.

"Huh? Ah, I... n-no, actually. I was going to stop somewhere on the way home, but..." She gestured vaguely at the broken car.

"I was just about to make dinner. Nothing fancy, just pasta and meatballs. There's plenty for two, if you'd like."

"I couldn't ask you to—"

"You're not asking, Miss Anne. I'm offering." Amy's chin lifted slightly, a hint of stubbornness entering her voice. "Please... let me do this. F-for... for You."

There was a deliberate weight to the words Amy had uttered; it went beyond the simple act of hospitality at a time of need.

Anne studied her for a moment, reading the subtle tension in her shoulders, the way her hands twisted in the apron strings.

"Alright," Anne said. "But please, let me help. I... know a thing or two around the kitchen."

Amy's face lit up. "Really? You don't have to—"

"I want to." Anne moved toward the kitchen. "Put me to work."

---

The kitchen was small, with barely enough room for two people to move without bumping into each other, but functional nonetheless. Anne found herself acutely aware of every accidental touch — Amy's shoulder brushing hers as she reached for a pan, their hands meeting briefly over the cutting board, the warmth of Amy's body when they stood side by side at the counter.

"You can start by mixing the meat," Amy said, pointing to a bowl containing ground beef and Italian sausage. "There's onion and garlic in the fridge. I usually add some breadcrumbs and an egg to bind it."

Anne said, "Yes, Chef" and proceeded to thoroughly wash her hands, a professional habit she could not break, before setting herself to work. She found the onion and garlic and peeled and chopped them with precise, economical movements, then mixed them into the meat with her fingers, kneading them in precisely.

"You're good at that," Amy observed, watching her form the mixture into small, uniform balls with just three fingers.

"Years of practice," Anne said, smiling slightly. "Not with meatballs, specifically. But... medicine does teach you to be precise with your hands."

"I never thought of it that way," Amy said whilst stirring a pot of tomato sauce, adding herbs and spices with the casual confidence of someone who had made this dish many times before. "I always imagined doctors were closer to scientists than to artists."

Anne gently chuckled. "Don't say that to a prosthetics specialist, or to a reconstructive surgeon. They'll kill you, you know. Jokes apart, their work — to remake maimed faces, missing eyes, ears, noses, or limbs, in a way that blends harmoniously and aesthetically with a patient's remaining features... is a form of medicine that borders on the artistic." Anne then paused, a meatball half-formed in her hands. She continued, "I digress, though. In my specialty, we are trained to read the human body. It's amazing, what the body can tell you. It speaks in a language of its own, one that goes beyond words — or consciousness."

Amy went still. "W-what do you mean?"

Anne resumed her work, keeping her voice carefully neutral. "I mean I am trained to read and interpret body language. I can infer many things about someone by their micro-expressions, the way they hold themselves, how they move, how they behave, even down to the words they choose... and avoid." She then glanced at Amy. "You'd be surprised at what you can learn about a person, just by paying attention."

Amy's next question was in part curiosity and in part a tease. "And... what have you learned about me?"

The words hung in the air between them for a few moments. Anne took her time collecting her thoughts before answering, placing the last meatball on the tray and washing her hands again before she spoke.

"I've learned that you're a genuinely kind and caring person," she said. "There's not one bit of performance to you. You genuinely *care* about people — strangers, even — in a way that costs you something.

"I've learned that you're stronger than you look. You've been through the loss of someone very meaningful to you recently and, though hurt, you're still standing.

"I've also learned that you're searching for something, though I'm not sure you know what it is yet."

Amy's cheeks flushed pink. She turned back to the sauce, stirring it with unnecessary vigour. "That's... that's very observant of you."

"It's my job to observe," Anne said as she dried her hands on a towel. "What else can I do?"

"Please get the pasta water going. There's a big pot in the cabinet next to the stove. It should be salted already..." Anne smiled and said, "Yes, Chef", and for a while they worked in silence, Anne filling the pot and setting it to boil while Amy browned the meatballs in a buttered pan. The kitchen filled with the smell of cooking meat, garlic and herbs, homey and warm.

At length, Amy broke the silence, which had stretched like a thin gauze veil.

"Miss Anne?" Amy's voice was small. "C-could I, um... ask you something?"

"Of course."

"Do you... do you know any psychiatrists? Being a doctor and all."

Anne turned to look at Amy. She was focused intently on the meatballs, not meeting her eyes. Anne's clinical experience told her right away that there was something within this girl that was begging to come out.

"I know several," Anne said carefully. "Why do you ask?"

"I... um... I've... b-been... um... having some t-trouble lately. With... with feelings. A-and... w-with dreams." Amy's voice dropped to barely above a whisper, with a tone Anne had not heretofore heard in the young woman, vulnerable and scared. "I... I was hoping maybe I could talk to someone about that."

"What kind of dreams?"

Amy was silent for a long moment. The meatballs sizzled in the pan. The pasta water began to bubble.

"Strange ones," she finally said. "Disturbing ones. Dreams that make me... um... f-feel things I... I was always told were... w-wrong..."

Anne leaned against the counter, giving Amy space but remaining present and emotionally close to her. "Would you like to tell me about them? I am not a psychiatrist, but I do have some psychiatric knowledge. After all," Anne concluded, "a doctor does need to identify a basket case so they can refer them to a psychiatrist." At her quip, Anne grinned wryly.

"I... I don't know if I can." Amy's hands had stopped moving. She stood frozen over the stove, shoulders tense. "You'll think I'm crazy. Heck, *I* think I am crazy."

"I'm a doctor, Amy. I've heard a great many things that people thought would make them sound crazy. Very few of them actually were." Anne paused. "And even if I weren't a doctor, I would hope you'd know by now that you can talk to me about *any*thing."

Amy turned off the burner. She stood there for a moment, her back to Anne, breathing fast and shallowly, and then she spoke, in a rush, as if the words had been dammed up inside her for too long.

"I... Last week... I... I had a dream. I was back at my uncle's ranch — he had horses, before he got sick — and I was in the barn, and there was a stallion and a mare, and they were..." She swallowed hard. "The stallion was mounting her. And I couldn't look away. I watched the whole thing, and I felt... I felt..."

"What did you feel?"

"Excited." The word came out strangled. "N-no... t-that... that's not it... I... I felt... a-aroused... God help me, I felt I was the mare... being mounted... A-and... and there was... s-something else, the mare just... accepted it. The way she let it happen... H-how she lowered her head and..." Amy's voice broke. "I woke up and I was... I had to... and afterwards I felt so ashamed, Miss Anne. What kind of person dreams about something like that and feels that way about it?"

Anne was quiet for a moment, processing. Then she said, gently, "A human person, Amy. A person with feelings and desires that she's only beginning to understand, and that come out in their dreams, sometimes in... unexpected, unexplained ways."

"But it's not... *normal*... I-is it?"

"Define normal." Anne moved closer, though she was careful not to crowd her. "There are a great many things that society tells us are abnormal that are, in fact, quite common. The only difference is that most people are too ashamed to talk about them."

Amy turned to face her, and Anne could see the tears threatening to spill from her eyes. "... T-there... there's... m-more," she whispered. "S... something happened a few weeks ago... at the diner..."

"Tell me."

"I... I was taking out the rubbish. It was... it was late, after closing. A-and a man... a man grabbed me. H-he... he dragged me... behind the dumpster. He... he had a knife, a-and he... he told me that... a-and..."

Amy was looking down, stumbling over her words so badly that she couldn't finish the sentence. "G-gus came out before anything happened... A-and the police caught the guy. N-nothing happened... a-and I'm fine..."

"...But something about your reaction frightened you," Anne said quietly for Amy. "Didn't it?"

Amy's face crumpled. "Miss Anne... I... I was not scared, and that frightened me. I should have been terrified, I should have been screaming and fighting, but instead I... I felt... I was... a-aroused... A-about... about him..."

She couldn't bring herself to finish, but she didn't need to. Anne understood where Amy was going. She reached out, took Amy's hands in hers, and found she was trembling.

"Amy... please listen to me." Anne's voice was calm, steady, the voice she used with patients who were on the verge of panic. "What you're describing — these feelings, these reactions — they don't make you broken. They don't make you crazy. They make you someone who is only now discovering a part of herself that has always been there, waiting to be understood."

"H-how... w-what... what do you mean?"

"Amy... I've spent over twenty years living a lifestyle that most people don't know exists."

Anne held Amy's gaze. "It is a lifestyle where the feelings you're describing are not only understood, but cherished. Where people like you are not freaks to be fixed, but treasures to be cultivated."

Amy stared at her. "W-what... what are you talking about?"

Anne took a breath. This was the moment. The threshold she had been approaching since the first time Amy had called her Miss at Marge's.

"I think," Anne said slowly, "that you and I need to have a longer conversation about that, when our heads are clear, and your soul and mind at ease. Now we should finish preparing our pasta, and eat it. We're cooking a beautiful meal, and... it would be a shame to let it get cold, don't you think?"

She released Amy's hands and turned toward the stove, where she poured the spaghetti into the pasta water, now at a rolling boil.

Behind her, she heard Amy whisper, "Yes, Miss Anne."

The words sent a shiver down Anne's spine.

---

They ate in the living room, on the worn leather sofa, plates balanced on their knees. The pasta was simple but delicious, and the small meatballs Anne had made were tender and flavourful. They had made enough for a small army, and Anne found herself eating more than she had in months.

"This is excellent," Anne said through a mouthful of pasta and meatballs, propriety be damned. And she meant it too.

Amy ducked her head, pleasure flushing her cheeks. "It's nothing special. Just something my mother taught me. And I had help. My meatballs are huge. Yours instead are the perfect size, Miss Anne."

"Regardless, your mother taught you well. Was she Italian by any chance?"

"Yes Miss Anne, third-generation, from a region called Umbria."

The two women ate in comfortable silence for a while. Outside, the night pressed against the windows. Inside, the yellow lamplight cast warm shadows across the room, making the cluttered space feel intimate and cosy.

"Miss Anne?" Amy set down her fork. "What you said earlier, about a lifestyle where... where people like me are understood. What did you mean?"

Anne finished chewing, took a sip of water, and set down her own plate. She had known this question was coming, and had been preparing for it.

"I meant," she said carefully, "that what you're experiencing — these feelings of wanting to yield, of being aroused at the prospect of being used, at the idea of surrendering... they have a name. That name is submission, and there are people who have devoted their lives to understand and explore them safely, consensually, with partners who share and complement those needs."

"You're talking about... BDSM?" Amy's voice was uncertain. "Like, leather and whips and... I've seen things online, but it all seemed so..."

"Theatrical?" Anne smiled slightly. "Much of what you see online is staged performance. The reality is both more mundane and more profound." She paused, considering how much to reveal. "Take it from me, Amy. I have lived within the BDSM lifestyle for most of my adult life."

Amy's eyes went wide. "You... you're..."

"I'm what's called a Dominant. It means I'm someone who takes the lead in certain kinds of relationships. I provide structure, guidance, control, and discipline to people who need... and want... those things." Anne held Amy's gaze. "And you, Amy, unless I'm very much mistaken, are what's called a submissive. You are someone who finds peace, fulfilment, and meaning in yielding control over themselves to someone they can trust."

Amy was silent for a long moment. Anne watched her as a whirlwind of conflicting emotions flickered across her face — confusion, recognition, fear... and underneath it all? hope.

"H-how..." Amy's voice was barely audible. "H-how did you know?"

"I told you, didn't I? The body speaks with a language of its own." Anne leaned back against the sofa cushions. "And you were screaming 'I am a servant' in the way you move when you serve someone, in the pleasure you take in anticipating needs, and in the way you say Miss — not ma'am, not lady, but Miss, like it means something more than just a conventional form of address. Not to mention the way you responded to my... observations, earlier, and the disproportionate pleasure you showed when I praised you."

"Y-you noticed all that?"

"I notice everything, Amy," said Anne. "It's both a gift and a curse." Anne's expression softened into a kind, understanding smile. "I noticed you from the very first day. And I've been... struggling, ever since, with what to do about it."

"Why struggling?"

Anne was quiet for a moment. When she spoke, her voice was tenderer than she intended.

"Because... the last servant I owned... was my Julia. She died two years ago, and I thought that, after her passing, part of my life was over forever." Anne closed her eyes briefly. "And then... I walked into a roadside diner, and a beautiful girl with honey-blonde hair called me Miss, and something inside me that I thought dead woke up. And to be perfectly honest with you, Amy... I have been terrified ever since."

Amy reached out and touched Anne's hand. The contact was tentative, questioning.

"I'm sorry about Julia," Amy said softly. "I... I didn't know."

"How could you? I never told you," Anne said, and turned her hand over, letting Amy's fingers rest in her palm. "But I'm telling you about it now. Because... if this is going to be anything more than a strange conversation on a strange night... you deserve to know what you'd be getting into... and who you'd be getting into it *with*."

"A woman who's still grieving."

"Yes."

"A woman who's scared."

"Yes."

"A woman who..." Amy hesitated. "Who maybe sees something in me that I'm only starting to see in myself?"

Anne looked at Amy, really looked at her, and felt something shift in her chest, like a lock turning, or a door opening.

"Yes," she said. "That too."

They sat there in the lamplight, hands loosely clasped, the remains of dinner cooling on the coffee table. Outside, the Mercedes sat dark and silent in the driveway, waiting for morning and repair. Inside, something fragile and new was taking its first tentative breath.

"What happens now?" Amy asked.

Anne considered the question. There were conversations to be had about so many things... long, involved negotiations about consent, limits, expectations, training, protocols...

But tonight was not about any of that.

"Now we clean up from dinner," Anne said. "And then, we sleep. Tomorrow, when the car is fixed and the sun is up and the world looks less strange... we have a proper chat about what all of this means, and what, if anything, we want to do about it."

Anne stood and began gathering the plates. After a moment, Amy rose to help her.

They washed the dishes together in companionable silence, shoulders brushing in the narrow kitchen, and if Anne noticed the way Amy instinctively deferred to her — waiting for direction, anticipating needs, moving to complement her rather than compete with her — she did not remark on it.

There would be time for that tomorrow.

---

The couch was more comfortable than it looked. Amy had provided a thick, handmade quilt, with careful and precise stitching, and a pillow that smelled faintly of lavender.

Anne lay in the darkness, listening to the unfamiliar sounds of the house settling around her. Somewhere down the hall, she could hear Amy moving in her bedroom, the soft sounds of someone preparing for sleep.

She thought about Julia. About the rosewood box in her closet, unopened for more than two years. About the collar inside it, severed, broken, a symbol of everything she had lost.

She thought about Amy. About the way she had knelt and submitted, metaphorically if not literally, throughout the entire evening. About the hunger in her eyes when Anne had named what she was. About the way she had whispered "Yes, Miss Anne," almost as if it was a prayer.

Anne thought about fear, and about hope, and about the strange alchemy that sometimes transformed one into the other.

She did not sleep for a long time.

When she finally did, she dreamt of honey-blonde hair and spring-sky eyes, and a voice that said Miss like it meant something more.

And in her dream, for the first time in two years, four months, and fifteen days... she smiled.
