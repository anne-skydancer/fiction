## Chapter Five: The Training

The collar changed everything.

Amy discovered this on her first morning as Anne's consideration servant, when she woke in the grey pre-dawn light with the leather still snug against her throat and Anne's arm draped warm and heavy across her waist. For a moment she lay still, afraid to move, afraid to breathe, afraid that any motion might shatter the fragile reality of what had happened.

Then Anne stirred, and her arm tightened, and her lips brushed the back of Amy's neck just above the collar's edge.

"Good morning, pet."

"Good morning, Mistress." The word still felt strange in Amy's mouth, too large and too formal, but it also felt right in a way she couldn't explain.

"How did you sleep?"

"Better than I have in... in a long time, Mistress."

Anne's hand moved to Amy's throat, fingers tracing the leather. "How does your collar feel?"

Amy considered the question. "It feels... present. I'm constantly aware of it. Every time I swallow, every time I turn my head..." She paused. "Is... is that... normal?"

"For the first few days, yes. Eventually it will become part of you, and you'll feel naked without it." Anne's voice was soft, remembering. "Julia used to say it felt like wearing her own heartbeat." Then, with a rueful smile, she added, "For me... the collar was a yoke. I felt strangled by it. Master Roger paddled the heck out of me because I was always trying to stretch it."

The mention of Julia sent a small tremor through Amy. She had known, intellectually, that she was not Anne's first. But lying here in Anne's bed, wearing Julia's collar, the reality of it settled into her bones. Anne's mention that *she* had been in her position, collared as someone's servant, suddenly gave Amy a broader, deeper picture of who her Mistress was, and what had she gone through to be where she was now.

"Mistress? May I ask you something?"

"You may always ask. I may not always answer."

"What was she like? Julia, I mean. And... how was your Master?"

Anne was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was rough with old grief. "She was... a brilliant, extraordinary woman. She was a child psychologist, did I tell you that? She could read people the way I read bodies. She knew what they needed before they knew it themselves." Anne paused, and sighed as memory flooded back. "She was also impossibly stubborn. She would argue with me about everything, and half the time she was right, too, which was infuriating."

"She sounds wonderful."

"She was." Anne pressed a kiss to Amy's shoulder. "And she would have liked you, I think. She always said I needed someone to take care of, that I withered without purpose." Another pause, as Anne remembered further back. "Master Roger was... a stern man with a heart of gold and a strict sense of propriety and discipline that came from years in the military. I was his slave for five years. That was my punishment for trying to steal his wallet. Being his property rescued me, you know. Without him, I would have probably ended up dead of an overdose in an Oakland back alley. I was broken, and Master fixed me. Thanks to him, I could go to medical school and find my calling in healing people, which in a way is a continuation of my service to him, to heal others like he healed me, I guess." As memory went back to more recent years, Anne drew a heavier sigh. "After Julia died, I thought... I thought that part of me died with her. I tried to lock it away and forget it existed."

"What changed?"

"You." Anne's arm tightened around her. "You, your spring-sky eyes and your *Miss* that meant something more. You woke up something I thought dead, Amy. And I've been terrified ever since."

Amy turned in Anne's arms, facing her. In the grey morning light, Anne's face was unguarded, vulnerable in a way Amy had never seen.

"I'm scared too, Mistress," Amy whispered. "But I'm more scared of going back to who I was before. Before you. Before... this."

Anne cupped her face, thumbed away a tear Amy hadn't realised she'd shed.

"Then we'll be scared together," Anne said. "And we'll learn together. Starting today."

The training began with kneeling.

They were in Anne's living room, the morning sun slanting through the windows, coffee cooling on the side table.

Amy was to present herself to her Mistress wearing nothing but her underwear. When she did, the blush on Amy's cheeks was almost nuclear red, and she felt her cheeks would soon catch on fire. It was the first time anyone had seen her wearing so little.

"How do you feel, pet?" said Anne.

"... M-m-mortified, Mistress... a-a-and... um... e-em... embarrassed too. You are the first person who sees me like... um... l-like... this..."

Anne nodded and came close to Amy. She then caressed her cheek, kindly, and said, "Go put on a house robe, pet. You and I have more or less the same size, so you can use one of mine. It's in the bathroom, hanging on a hook behind the door. When you're ready, we'll do without it."

A few minutes later, Amy returned, wearing one of Anne's satin silk house robes that reached to mid-thigh and flattered her younger body.

"How do you feel now, pet?" said Anne.

"Better, Mistress. T-thank you." Amy's voice was still flustered, but the crippling embarrassment was gone.

"Good. Then, we can begin." Anne then knelt easily and fluidly, showing Amy the pose she expected of her.

"There are many kneeling positions," Anne explained while holding the position with a calm grace and poise that spoke of weeks spent practising it and assuming it on command. "Different households use different protocols. The pose I am in is the one I taught Julia, and the one which was taught to me when I served."

Amy knelt on the carpet, trying to hold herself the way Anne had shown her — back straight, knees apart, hands resting palm-up on her thighs. It was harder than it looked. Her muscles ached with the effort of stillness.

"This is called *present*," Anne said, circling her slowly. "It's your default position when you're awaiting instructions. Back straight — yes, like that. Chin level, eyes down unless given permission to look up. Hands open, resting palms up on your thighs, to show you're ready to receive."

"Receive what, Mistress?"

"Whatever I choose to give you. Instruction... praise... or correction." Anne's hand brushed the top of Amy's head with a fleeting touch. "The position communicates readiness, openness and trust."

Amy felt herself settling into the posture, her breathing slowing, her mind quieting. There was something almost meditative about it, about the deliberate surrender of agency.

"Good," Anne murmured. "You're a natural. Most people fidget for weeks before they can hold still like this."

The praise washed through Amy like warm water. She felt herself flush, felt her breath catch.

"That," Anne said, noting the reaction, "is what we call *subspace*. The altered state that comes from submission. Some servants describe it as floating. Others as sinking. It's different for everyone."

"It feels like... like everything else fades away. Like there's only you and me and this moment."

"Yes. That's exactly right." Anne knelt in front of her, bringing their faces level. "Subspace is a gift, Amy. It's also a responsibility. When you're deep in it, you may not be able to advocate for yourself. That's why trust matters so much. That's why we're taking this slowly."

"I understand, Mistress."

"Do you?" Anne's eyes searched hers. "Tell me your safeword."

"Geronimo, Mistress."

"And if you can't speak?"

"I tap three times, and then three more. On you, on the floor, on whatever's closest."

"Good girl."

The praise hit differently this time, deeper, resonating in some part of Amy she hadn't known existed. Her eyes fluttered closed.

"Stay with me," Anne said gently. "Not too deep. Not yet. We're just beginning."

---

The days took on a new rhythm.

Anne had a practice to maintain. Amy had her shifts at Marge's. They couldn't be together every moment, much as both of them might have wished it. But the collar was a constant presence, a reminder that Amy was no longer alone.

She wore it under her uniform, hidden beneath the collar of her blouse. No one at the diner noticed — or, if they did, they didn't comment. But Amy knew it was there. With every swallow, with every turn of her head, the leather whispered against her skin: *You belong to someone. You have a purpose. You are not lost.*

Anne called every evening at nine o'clock, without fail.

"How was your day, pet?"

"Long, Mistress. We were short-staffed again. Maria's baby has an ear infection."

"Did you eat properly?"

"Yes, Mistress. I had chicken salad for lunch, and made pasta with tomato sauce when I got home."

"Good girl. And your exercises?"

Amy had been given homework. She had to practice kneeling for twenty minutes each morning, and dedicate an hour each evening to journaling, jotting down her thoughts, feelings, and writing down any questions that arose. There were also some readings Anne had assigned, about the psychology of power exchange, the ethics of consent, and the history of their lifestyle.

"I did them, Mistress. I have some questions about the readings, for when we see each other."

"We'll tackle your questions on Saturday," Anne promised. "I'll pick you up after your shift. I have a feeling we will have much to talk about."

---

Saturday came with a phone call Amy hadn't expected.

She was in the middle of her morning kneeling practice, collar on, eyes closed, mind drifting toward that head space Anne had shown her, when her phone buzzed on the nightstand. She ignored it at first — practice was Amy's sacred time, Anne had said, and it was not to be interrupted for anything short of emergency.

The phone kept buzzing nonetheless. Three calls in a row. Then a string of text messages.

Amy broke position and reached for the phone, her heart already sinking.

*Mom - 7:23 AM*
*Amy honey call me back*

*Mom - 7:24 AM*
*Your aunt says you've been seeing someone???*

*Mom - 7:25 AM*
*Why didn't you tell us???*

*Mom - 7:26 AM*
*Your father wants to know who he is*

*Mom - 7:27 AM*
*AMY CALL ME PLS*

Amy stared at the screen, blood draining from her face.

Aunt Rosa.

She'd completely forgotten about *her*.

Aunt Rosa lived in Napa, and was the kind of person that knew people who knew people. In Napa Valley... that meant gossip reached Aunt Rosa *fast*.

Amy should have been more careful. She should have been more discreet. But how could she have hidden the way her face lit up when Anne picked her up from work, or the way she leaned into the Mercedes like it was a sanctuary?

Her phone buzzed again.

*Mom - 7:28 AM*
*Your father is very upset*

*Mom - 7:28 AM*
*He's talking about driving up there*

*Mom - 7:29 AM*
*Please just call us*

Amy's hands shook as she typed a reply.

*I'm fine Mom. I'll call you tonight. Please don't let Dad drive up. Everything is okay.*

She sent the message, then sat on her bed, collar heavy around her throat, and tried to remember how to breathe.

---

Anne knew something was wrong the moment Amy got in the car.

"What happened?"

Amy told her everything — about her mother's phone calls and texts, about Aunt Rosa the valley gossip, and about her father threatening to drive up from San Francisco.

Anne listened in silence, her face unreadable.

"What did you tell them?" she asked when Amy finished.

"Nothing yet. I said I'd call tonight." Amy twisted her hands in her lap. "I don't know what to say. I can't tell them the truth, they... they wouldn't understand. My father... he's a very traditional Catholic. He thinks anything outside of marriage between man and woman is a sin."

"And your mother?"

"She follows his lead. She always has." Amy's voice cracked. "They... they're going to want to meet you. They're going to want to know who you are, what your intentions are, whether we're... a-about... why... I'm... s-seeing..."

"...A woman?"

Amy nodded miserably.

"I... I never told them about that part of me. I always dated boys, both in high school and college. It was easier. Safer." She looked at Anne with wet eyes.

"F-forgive me, Mistress... I... I should have warned you. I should have—"

"Stop."

Anne's voice was firm but not unkind. She pulled the car to the side of the road and turned to face Amy fully.

"You have nothing to apologise for. Your family, your past, your secrets — those are yours to share or keep as you see fit.

"I don't require you to out yourself to anyone. Do you understand?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"What I do require is honesty between us. I want no secrets that might affect our dynamic, nothing that could harm what we're building."

Anne reached out and touched Amy's collar through her blouse.

"This is between you and me. The rest of the world doesn't get a vote."

"But what do I tell them?"

Anne was quiet for a moment.

"That depends on what you want, Amy. What kind of relationship do you want with your family? What are you willing to sacrifice? What are you willing to fight for?"

"I... I don't know, Mistress," Amy whispered. "I've never had anything worth fighting for before."

Anne's hand moved from the collar to Amy's cheek.

"Then perhaps it's time you figured that out. And whatever you decide, I'll support you. That's what a Mistress does."

Amy leaned into the touch, closing her eyes.

"Thank you, Mistress."

"Don't thank me yet. We haven't even begun to navigate this." Anne started the car again. "But we will. Together."

---

That evening, Amy called her mother.

She sat on Anne's sofa, the phone pressed to her ear, with Anne close enough to provide moral support with her presence, but giving her space to have the conversation alone.

"Hi, Mom."

"Amy! Finally! We've been worried sick. Your aunt said she saw you getting into a fancy car with some older woman? She said you looked... happy, Amy... and I guess your father and I just want to know—"

"I *am* happy, Mom." The words came out stronger than Amy had expected. "I am happier than I've been in a long time."

A pause on the other end. "Who is she?"

"Her name is Anne. She's a doctor and lives in St. Helena."

"A doctor." Her mother's voice was carefully neutral. "And you two are... what, exactly?"

Amy looked at Anne, who nodded encouragingly.

"We're... dating, I suppose. Maybe more. It's complicated."

"You're dating a *woman.*"

"Yes, Mom. I'm *dating* a woman."

Silence stretched across the line. Amy could hear her father's voice in the background, demanding to know what was being said.

"Your father wants to talk to you," her mother said finally.

"I know he does. But I'm not ready for that conversation yet."

Amy took a breath.

"I... I just wanted you to know that I'm okay. I'm safe. I'm seeing a girl, Mom. I'm *not* hanging out with Charles Manson or anything like that. I'm with someone who cares about me and treats me well. Can that be enough for now?"

There was another long, pregnant pause. "I don't understand any of this, Amy..."

"I know, Mom. I'm still figuring it out myself."

Amy felt tears threatening.

"I'm not asking you to understand. I'm just asking you to trust that I know what I'm doing."

"Do you? Do you really?"

Amy looked at Anne again. At her dark eyes, her steady presence, her hand resting just inches away, ready to offer comfort if needed.

"Yes, Mom, I do," Amy said. "I really do."

---

After the call ended, Amy sat in the silence for a long moment. Then she turned to Anne.

"I... I couldn't tell her everything, Mistress."

"I know."

"I... I don't know whether I will be able to, Mistress. Not yet. Maybe not ever."

"That's entirely your choice to make, my pet." Anne opened her arms, and Amy fell into them gratefully. "You did well. That was *very* brave of you."

"I didn't *feel* brave. I felt terrified, Mistress."

"Bravery usually does come together with a good dose of terror, pet," said Anne, stroking Amy's hair. "How do you feel now?"

"Shaky... Relieved... Guilty too, Mistress." Amy pressed her face into Anne's shoulder. "But I also feel like I've just taken the first step off a cliff and I don't know whether I'm going to fly... or fall."

"Then I'll be here to catch you," Anne said. "That's my promise. I will be there *for you*, whatever happens."

Amy clung to her, the collar pressing against her throat like a heartbeat, and let herself believe it.

Outside, the valley darkened into night. Inside, two women held each other, navigating the first tremors of a storm that was only beginning to gather.

The training would continue. The challenges would multiply. But for now, in this moment, they had each other.

It was enough.

It had to be.
