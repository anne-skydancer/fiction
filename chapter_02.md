## Chapter Two: The Ride Home

It was past nine when Anne pulled into Marge's parking lot for what she told herself would be the last time.

She had a reason, of course. She always had reasons. This one involved a patient in Yountville whose blood pressure had spiked alarmingly during an afternoon check-up, necessitating a return visit to ensure the new medication was taking effect. The visit had run long, the patient anxious and talkative, and by the time Anne extracted herself the sun had already slipped behind the western hills, leaving the valley bathed in the blue-grey light of early evening.

The diner was on her way home. She was hungry. These were facts, and facts were safe things to hold onto.

What she had not expected was to find Amy standing outside the building, alone, her arms wrapped around herself against the cooling air. The girl was still in her work clothes, a light cardigan thrown over her uniform shirt, and she was staring down the empty road with the resigned patience of someone who had been waiting for a long time and expected to wait longer still.

Anne slowed the Mercedes and pulled into the lot. She lowered the passenger window.

"Amy? Is everything all right?"

The girl turned, and her face cycled through surprise, recognition, and something that looked almost like relief. "Miss? I... I didn't expect to see you tonight."

"I had a late appointment." Anne studied her for a moment. "Are you waiting for someone?"

"The bus." Amy smiled, nervously. "I usually catch the 5:15 back to Yountville, but we were short-staffed today and I couldn't leave until closing. The next one isn't until..." She trailed off, glancing at her watch. "Um... Tomorrow morning, apparently."

"You were planning to wait here all night?"

"I... I was going to call a taxi." More softly, Amy said, "... eventually..." The nervousness cracked, revealing embarrassment beneath. "I... I keep telling myself I need to get a car, but between the rent and the lawyer's fees for my uncle's estate, there's never quite enough left over."

Anne considered her options. The sensible thing would be to wish Amy a good evening and drive away. The sensible thing would be to maintain the careful distance she had been cultivating, to keep their interactions confined to the neutral territory of coffee and pancakes and excessive tips.

The sensible thing had stopped mattering since around the third day she'd caught herself making up reasons to visit Marge's.

"Get in," Anne said. "I'll take you home."

Amy hesitated, and Anne watched the calculation play across her features: the ingrained wariness of accepting rides from relative strangers weighed against the prospect of the not wholly truthful statement about waiting alone at night in a dark parking lot for a taxi. Yet Anne did not rush her. This had to be Amy's choice, freely made.

"Are you sure?" Amy asked. "I don't want to take you out of your way."

"Yountville is on my route. I pass through it twice a day." Anne reached across and pushed open the passenger door. "Please. I insist."

Amy climbed in, settling into the leather seat with a small sound of appreciation. "This car is beautiful," she said, running her fingers along the wood grain of the dashboard. "It feels like something out of a film."

"It was my father's." Anne pulled out of the lot and turned south onto the highway. "A 1970 Mercedes 300 SEL. He bought it the year I was born and drove it until the day he died. I inherited it along with his stubbornness and his tendency to hold onto things long past the point of practicality."

"That's not impractical. That's... I don't know. Faithful, maybe."

The word landed strangely in Anne's chest. She kept her eyes on the road.

"Where in Yountville?" she asked.

Amy gave her an address on the outskirts of town, a road Anne recognised as one of the older residential areas, far from the tasting rooms and boutique hotels that had transformed the village's centre. They drove in comfortable silence for a few minutes, the Mercedes humming along the darkening highway, until Amy spoke again.

"Can I ask you something, Miss?"

"Anne. Please."

"... Anne..." Amy tested the name as if learning its weight. "You've been coming to Marge's quite often now. I'm not complaining, you know, but I've noticed that you don't seem like the diner type. You're..." She paused, searching for the right word. "You're too refined, I suppose. There must be better restaurants between Vallejo and St. Helena."

"Yes, there are. I know several of the owners on a first-name basis, too."

"So why Marge's?"

Anne considered several responses, most of them evasive. But Amy had asked the question directly, and something in her tone suggested she genuinely wanted to understand, not merely to make conversation.

"The food is honest," Anne said finally. "There's no performative hubris, which is refreshing; and no weird fusions, either. Marge's is true blue, honest, hometown cooking, no more, no less. And besides, the service has been exceptional."

She felt Amy's dark blush in the halting, embarrassed tone of the girl's voice. "... Y-you, um... you d-don't... have to say that, you know..."

"I don't say things I don't mean, Amy. It wastes time, mine and other people's." Anne glanced over briefly. "You're very good at what you do. You have a gift for anticipating what people need and providing it without being asked. That's rarer than you might think."

Amy was quiet for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice was softer. "My uncle used to say something like that. He said I was born to take care of people. I never knew whether he meant it as a compliment or a warning."

"Perhaps both."

"Y-yeah." Amy softly giggled, but with a nervous edge Anne did not fail to recognise. "... Perhaps both."

They turned off the highway onto a smaller road that wound through vineyards before giving way to older houses set back from the street. The properties here had been modest once, working-class homes for the people who actually laboured in the fields and wineries, before the influx of money had transformed Napa Valley into a gentrified quasi-suburban garden, unrecognisable to those who remembered what it had been. Some of the houses had been renovated, their original character buried beneath fresh paint and modern additions. Others remained as they had always been, slowly surrendering to time and neglect.

The house at Amy's address was one of the latter.

It was a single-storey structure, its paint faded to an indeterminate grey, front lawn more brown than green. A rusted mailbox leaned at an angle near the road, and the porch light was dark. The only illumination came from a single window at the side of the house, a yellow glow that suggested someone had left a lamp burning against the night.

Amy's hand went to the door handle, then stopped. "I-it's not much," she said in a small voice, a defensive note creeping into her words. "... M-my uncle wasn't much for upkeep, even... even before he got sick, and I've been so busy with work and the estate that I haven't had time to—"

"Amy... Shh. Stop." Anne's eyes, for the first time, intently gazed into Amy, who held the stare for a moment before averting her eyes. "... You... don't owe me an explanation."

Amy looked at her. In the dim light of the car's interior, her eyes were darker than Anne remembered, their blue deepened to something closer to indigo. "... I... I know. I just... I don't usually bring people here. It's embarrassing."

"It's a house. It has walls and a roof and it keeps you dry when it rains. There's nothing embarrassing about that."

"You... you're very practical, aren't you, M... Anne?"

"I'm a doctor. Practicality is a professional requirement." Anne paused, then added, more gently: "Your uncle was fortunate that you were with him." In a softer, more emotional voice, Anne continued, "Not everyone has someone who's willing to put their own life on hold to..." Anne paused, pursed her lips, and then said, composedly, "... to be with them... at the end..."

Amy's breath caught. For a moment, Anne thought she might cry. But she swallowed whatever emotion had risen in her throat and managed a small, tight smile. "T... thank you... f-for saying that. Most people just tell me I should sell the house and move on. They don't... They don't understand that it's not that simple."

"Grief... is never simple. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying... or they have never lost someone they loved."

The words hung in the air between them. Amy studied Anne's face intently, and Anne held her ground against the scrutiny. She had said more than she had intended, and let something slip through the careful walls she'd built, but now... now it was too late to take it back.

"You've lost someone," Amy said. It wasn't a question.

Anne sighed. The tight, soft "yes" elicited from her mouth carried a pang of pain, never fully healed or resolved.

"Recently?"

"... Two years ago... And three months.... And eleven days." Anne heard herself speak the numbers and felt her chest tighten. "But who's counting?"

Amy reached out and touched Anne's hand where it rested on the gear lever. The contact was brief, barely more than a brush of fingertips, but it sent a jolt through Anne's body that she felt all the way to her spine. She forced herself not to react, not to pull away, not to lean into the touch the way some starving part of her wanted to.

"I'm sorry," Amy said. "That's not long at all."

"No. It isn't."

They sat in silence for a moment, the engine idling, the dashboard lights casting soft shadows across their faces. Then Amy withdrew her hand and reached for the door.

"Thank you for the ride, Miss Anne. I really appreciated it."

"It was no trouble." Anne reached into her purse and withdrew a business card, one of the simple cream-coloured ones she kept for personal use rather than the more formal cards she distributed to patients. "If you ever need anything, or if you'd like to talk, please call me. Any time."

Amy took the card and studied it. "Anne Marquez, M.D.," she read aloud. "Internal Medicine and Surgery. By Appointment Only." She looked up. "Is this your way of telling me you make house calls?"

The question was innocent, but something in Amy's tone gave it an edge that might have been flirtatious.

"Maybe," Anne said, with a hint of flirtatiousness to her own voice. "Or... maybe... it's my way of telling you that you have a friend in the valley, if you want one. Moving to a new place and managing what you have to manage is hard enough. You... don't have to do it alone."

"I'm not alone. There's Gus, at the diner. And Maria checks in on me sometimes, even though she's got her own baby to deal with." Amy tucked the card into her pocket. "But thank you. It means a lot."

She opened the door and stepped out into the cool evening air. Anne watched her walk up the cracked concrete path to the front door, watched her fumble with her keys in the dim light, watched the door open and the yellow lamplight spill out to greet her.

Amy turned before going inside. She raised a hand in a small wave, and Anne returned it. Then the door closed, and Anne was alone.

She sat in the driveway for far longer than she should have, staring at the dark house, feeling the weight of what she'd just said and done settle over her like a heavy blanket. She had offered friendship. She had given Amy her number. She had opened a door that she knew, with absolute certainty, should have remained closed.

*What are you doing?* she asked herself. *What do you think is going to happen here?*

She had no answer. Or rather, she had too many answers, and all of them frightened and to a lesser extent titillated her.

Anne put the car in reverse and backed out of the driveway. She drove back home through the darkness, past the vineyards, the tasting rooms and the expensive restaurants where people paid two hundred dollars for a meal that wasn't half as satisfying as Marge's pancakes, and she tried not to think about the girl she'd just left behind at a dark house in the middle of nowhere, California.

She failed.

The house in St. Helena was dark when Anne arrived. She had forgotten to leave a light on that morning, and she stood for a moment in the entryway, listening to the silence that greeted her.

It had been different when Julia was alive. She had always left lights burning and had music playing softly in the background, filling the house with the sounds and movements of a life being lived with someone. Coming home had meant coming home to someone, to warmth and presence and the particular kind of peace that came from knowing you were expected and wanted.

That that someone also waited kneeling at the door, all but nude in a diaphanous, sheer shift that both concealed and exalted her womanly form, a minimal, steel collar permanently adorning her slender neck... was one hell of a perk for the Mistress of the house.

Now?

Now... Coming home meant walking into darkness and turning on lights one by one, each switch a small acknowledgment that there was no one else but her to do it.

Anne moved through the house mechanically, illuminating rooms she hadn't used in years, trying to dispel the emptiness with the glare of artificial light. She poured herself a glass of wine from a bottle she'd opened three days ago, tasted it, found it had turned, and poured it down the sink with a disheartened sigh. She stood by the french windows leading from the kitchen to the garden and looked out at the herb plot Julia had planted, now overgrown with weeds Anne couldn't bring herself to pull.

Her phone sat on the counter where she'd left it that morning. She picked it up and scrolled through the day's messages: appointment confirmations, a note from her accountant about quarterly taxes, a reminder about a medical conference she had no intention of attending. There was nothing from Amy. Of course there was nothing, she had only just given the girl her number, what did she expect!?

She found herself hoping anyway.

*This is pathetic,* Anne thought. *You're forty-one years old. You've built a life, a career, and a reputation. Yet here you are, pining, constantly checking your phone like a teenager waiting for a crush to call.*

Anne shook her head in disapproval, set the phone down and walked to her bedroom.

The walk-in closet was divided the way it had always been: Anne's side to the right, Julia's to the left. Anne used her side every day, reaching for blouses and slacks, but without ever looking across the narrow space to where Julia's clothes still hung, preserved in garment bags, and her shoes were still lined up in neat rows. Her jewellery box sat, unopened, on the built-in dresser, beside the small, wooden box that held the most poignant relic yet of her late servant.

Anne had not opened that small, rosewood box since the day when, devastated, she had placed the severed collar inside it. She had not yet been able to bring herself to look at that broken metal circlet and confront what its presence represented.

Tonight, however, for reasons she couldn't quite articulate, she found herself standing on Julia's side of the closet, her hand hovering over the rosewood box's lid.

She didn't open it. Not tonight.

But she did stand there for a long time, breathing in the faint ghost of Julia's perfume that still clung to the garment bags, and wondered. Would she ever be ready to face the implications of confronting what lay inside that symbolic urn?

---

In Yountville, Amy sat on the floor of her uncle's living room, surrounded by boxes she still hadn't unpacked, and stared at the business card in her hand.

Anne Marquez, M.D.

She traced the letters with her finger, remembering the way Anne had looked at her in the car, that strange intensity in her dark eyes that made Amy feel seen in a way she couldn't quite explain. Anne looked at her the way no one had ever looked at her before, as if Amy were a puzzle worth solving, a book worth reading.

It should have been unsettling. In some ways it was, very much so.

Underneath the unease, however, there was something else, deep, and dark, and confusing in its turbulence.

When Anne had told her she was good at her job, Amy had felt a rush of pleasure that was entirely out of proportion to the compliment; and when Anne had said she didn't waste time saying things she didn't mean, Amy had believed her absolutely, unquestionably, in a way in which she never had believed anyone. Then, when Anne had touched on her own loss, in that brief, unguarded, vulnerable moment, breaking through her composed exterior, Amy had wanted nothing more than to reach out and comfort her.

The impulse had been overwhelming, almost physical in its intensity, and Amy had barely managed to limit herself to that brief touch on Anne's hand.

What was that about?

More poignantly... What did it *mean* to her? What did it *say* about her?

Was this a new side to herself she hadn't realised existed?

Amy didn't have an answer. She only knew that something had shifted tonight. An invisible line had been crossed, and she wasn't sure whether to be excited... or afraid. Perhaps she was *both* excited _and_ afraid. She could not tell. It was too soon to give *this* a name.

She looked again at Anne's card, almost as if wanting to memorise what had happened, and at length she tucked it into her wallet, in the slot behind her driver's licence, where she could see it every day. Then she got up, turned off the lamp, and went to bed.

That night, she dreamt of dark eyes, and a voice that said *Miss* like it meant something more.
