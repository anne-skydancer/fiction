## Chapter Six: The Test

Three weeks after the phone call, Amy's mother came to visit.

She arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, without warning, driving a rented Toyota up Anne's driveway.

Amy was alone in the house — Anne had a patient in Calistoga, the vintner with gout who still refused to modify his diet — and she answered the door clad in her house robe and nothing else, her collar visible, the sheerness of the robe hinting at her nudity under it, and completely unprepared for what was about to unfold.

"Mom?"

Elena Castillo was a small woman in her mid-fifties, with Amy's honey-blonde hair gone grey at the temples and eyes that were the same spring-sky blue but harder, more guarded. She stood on the doorstep holding her purse like a shield, taking in the house, the grounds, and her daughter's state of undress with a single sweeping glance.

"You weren't answering your phone," she said. "I got worried."

"I was..." Amy moved to touch her collar instinctively, then caught herself. "I was doing chores. I didn't hear it ring."

A more poignant question gnawed at Amy's mind, though. *How did my mom get this address? I left no forwarding address in Yountville or at the diner...*

"You were doing *chores,* dressed like *that,* basically butt naked, in the middle of the afternoon?"

"It's a house robe, Mom. And yes, I *was* doing chores. I *live* here now, you know." Amy's voice grew tense, defensive.

The words hung between them. Amy hadn't meant to announce it quite so baldly, but there it was. She had moved her things from the Yountville house two weeks ago. Her uncle's estate was finally settled; the house in Yountville had been vacated and put up for sale, and Maria was back full-time at the diner.

Anne had made the invitation without making it seem like charity.

*You belong here, with me,* Anne had said. *I do, Mistress,* Amy had said. Besides, it felt *right.*

Elena's eyes moved past Amy to the interior of the house — the high ceilings, the art on the walls, the view of the valley through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Something shifted in her expression, too quick to name.

"May I come in?"

---

They sat in the living room after Amy put on proper clothes and made a white tea that neither of them touched.

Elena perched on the edge of Anne's sofa like a bird ready for flight, her eyes cataloguing everything: the quality of the furniture, the number and quality of the paintings, and the photographs on the mantle, all still featuring Anne and Julia prominently.

"So... This is where your... friend... lives?"

"Her *name* is Anne, Mom, and... she's more than a friend."

"Yes. Your aunt made that *quite* clear."

Elena's mouth thinned.

"The whole valley is talking, Amy. Do you have any idea about what people are saying?"

"I *don't* care about that, Mom."

"Well, *I* do. Your father does, too. We have a reputation—"

"A *reputation?*" Amy felt a hot stab of anger rising within her chest. She drew a sharp breath in, then said, "You didn't *care* about reputation when Uncle Cyrus was dying. *None* of you came. None of you *helped.* I was the only one who—"

"Cyrus made his choices." Elena's voice was flat. "He knew what he was doing when he cut himself off from the family."

"He *didn't* cut himself off. *You* cut him out. Because he was gay, because he wouldn't pretend to be something he wasn't—"

"And look where that got him. He died alone, in that awful little house, with nothing to show for his life but debts and that *ridiculous* lamp."

Amy went very still. "That 'ridiculous lamp' is worth more than your *car,* Mom."

Elena's eyes sharpened.

"Is it?"

Something in Elena's tone made Amy's stomach turn.

She thought about the questions her mother had asked over the past weeks — they seemed like casual questions, slipped into phone conversations like afterthoughts.

'What does Anne do exactly?'

'Where did she go to medical school?'

'Does she own the house outright?'

Amy had answered without thinking. She'd been so grateful for the renewed contact, so hungry for some *sign* that her family might accept her new life, that she hadn't noticed the pattern.

"Why are you really here, Mom?"

Elena set down her untouched tea. "I'm here because I'm worried about you, Amy. You've dropped out of school and moved in with a woman twice your age. You're wearing—" she gestured at Amy's throat, where the collar was visible above her blouse, "—whatever *that* is. This... This isn't *you.*"

"This is *exactly* me, Mom. This is more like *me* than I've ever been."

"You're twenty-four years old. You don't know who you are yet."

"I know I'm *happy.* Isn't that enough?"

"*Happy.*" Elena scoffed and spat out the word as if it tasted sour. "Happy doesn't pay bills, Amy. Happy doesn't build a future. What happens when this... this *woman* gets tired of you? What happens when she finds someone younger, prettier, more... whatever it is she's looking for? Where will you be then?"

"Anne isn't going to—"

"She's done it before, hasn't she?" Elena nodded toward the photographs on the mantle. "What about the other one... Julia? How long were they together before she died?"

Amy felt her anger rise again, the blood rushing to her face. "That's *none* of your business, Mom. How'd you find out about Julia, anyway?"

"I know a lot of things, sweetheart." Elena's voice softened, but her eyes remained hard. "I know this house is worth two million dollars. I know Anne's practice brings in four hundred thousand a year. I know she has investments, properties, a trust fund from her family—"

"Stop."

"—and I know she's forty-one years old, unmarried, and vulnerable to someone who knows how to play the long game."

Amy stood up so fast she nearly knocked over the tea service. "*Get. Out.*"

"Amy—"

"Get *out* of this house, *Mom.* **Now.**"

Elena didn't move. "Think about what you're throwing away. Your family. Your future. Your inheritance—"

"*What* inheritance? Uncle Cyrus left me nothing but that house and the lamp because none of you wanted anything to do with him. And he was worth ten of all of you."

"He was a fool who died alone. Is that what you want?"

"I'd rather die alone than live like you." Amy's voice cracked. "I... I can't *believe* you. All the phone calls, all the contact you had with me... was because you were measuring Anne's worth? Is that why you came? To scope out Anne's assets? To see if there was something worth extracting?"

Elena rose, gathering her purse with dignity. "I came because you're my daughter, and I was worried. Clearly, that was a mistake."

"No. Coming here to try to turn me into a... a *honey trap* for my own girlfriend — *that* was the mistake."

"*Girlfriend.*" Elena spat out that word and bitterly scoffed. "Is that what you think you are? *Look* at yourself, Amy. Look at what you're wearing around your neck. You're not her girlfriend. You're her *pet.*"

The word was meant to land like a slap. Amy felt it reverberate through her, but it gave her strength, because it was *true* — and her mother would never understand why *that* truth was anything but shameful.

"Yes," Amy said quietly. "I am. And I've never been happier."

Elena stood and stared at Amy for a long moment. Her lips opened to retort, but Amy raised a hand and said, "Not. Another. Word. From you."

Her eyes stung. Tears — of pain, of fury, of heartache, of loss — were welling up. Taking a deep breath, Amy said, "I am going to ask you one last time, Mom. Get *out* of this house, or I will call the police. You... and Dad..." she balled her hands like fists and tightened her jaw before saying, "are *dead* to me."

Amy's words landed on Elena like a slap. Amy was breathing deep, looking at her mother with cold fury in her eyes. Elena tried to say something, but Amy screamed, "OUT!"

Then Elena turned and walked to the door without another word.

Amy didn't follow her. She stood in the living room, trembling, listening to the sound of the rental car starting and pulling away. Only when the engine noise faded completely did she let herself sink to her knees on the carpet, exactly where she'd first learned to present herself to Anne.

The tears that had welled up in her eyes flowed, like rivers. She knelt there, sobbing her soul out, for a long time. Then, when it was all over, she cleaned herself, and went back to her kneel, hands on her thighs, palms up, breathing slowly, waiting.

---

Anne found her like that when she came home an hour later. She knew immediately that something *had* happened.

"Amy?" Anne's keys clattered onto the side table. She crossed the room quickly, kneeling in front of her servant. "Amy, what happened? What's wrong, mine?"

Amy looked up. Her eyes were dry, but her eyelids were puffy, the sclera was still a bit red, and something in them had changed — there was a clarity in Amy's gaze that hadn't been there before.

"... My mother came to visit, Mistress," she said.

Anne listened in silence as Amy told her everything, from her mother's unannounced arrival to the revelation that her family had been researching Anne's finances. Then, she told her about the accusations, the confrontation, and the final, ugly exchange.

When Amy finished, Anne was quiet for a long moment.

"I'm sorry that you had to face that alone, pet."

"I'm not." Amy said, her voice still tremulous. "I'm *glad* I did. I needed to see my family clearly. I needed to know what they *really* wanted."

"And now you know."

"*Now* I know." Amy reached up and touched her collar. "They see this as leverage on you, Mistress. They see it as an in, as a way to access your money. They don't see it for what it really *is.*"

"What is it really?"

Amy met Anne's eyes. "It's a symbol of freedom, Mistress. I've never been freer than I am right now, kneeling at your feet. Does that make sense?"

"Yes," Anne said softly. "It makes perfect sense."

She helped Amy to her feet, then held her close. Amy pressed her face into Anne's shoulder, breathing in the familiar scent of her — sandalwood, antiseptic, and the enticingly sweet hint of a scent underneath it all that was purely Anne.

"I don't have a family anymore," Amy whispered.

"You have me, mine."

"Is that enough?"

Anne pulled back to look at her. "I don't know, pet. Is it?"

Amy considered the question seriously. She thought about her mother's face, hard with calculation. She remembered her father's voice on the phone, demanding answers he wasn't entitled to. She remembered the years of feeling like an outsider in her own home, of being the black sheep's niece, the one who never quite fit.

"Yes, Mistress," she said. "It's enough. It is *way* more than enough."

---

That night, Anne couldn't sleep.

She lay in the dark, listening to Amy's breathing, feeling the warmth of her servant's body curled against her side. Amy slept deeply, exhausted by the day's confrontation, but Anne's mind wouldn't quiet. Amy's words haunted her.

*They see this as leverage on you, Mistress. They see it as an in, as a way to access your money. They don't see it for what it really is.*

Those words circled tirelessly within her mind. She was not worried about Amy — the girl had proven herself today with flying colours. She had chosen Anne over her own blood in a way that still made Anne's chest ache. Those words had stirred something else. Something older.

*What do you think you're doing?* she asked herself. *Look at yourself, taking in a girl half your age, and dressing her in Julia's collar too? You... You're playing house like the past two years never happened!*

She slipped out of bed carefully, not wanting to wake Amy, and padded barefoot down the hall to the walk-in closet.

Julia's side was exactly as she'd left it. The garment bags, the shoes lined in neat rows, the jewellery box... And beside it, the rosewood box that Anne hadn't dared to open in over two years.

She stood there, in darkness, her hand hovering over the lid.

*You're using her,* the voice in her head said. It sounded like Julia at her most cutting, in the tone she'd use when Anne was being stubborn or self-deceptive. *You're using this girl to avoid dealing with me. To pretend you've moved on when we both know you haven't, my beautiful, stubborn Mistress.*

"That's not true," Anne whispered.

*Isn't it? Then why haven't you opened this box? Why is my collar still in here, untouched, while you dress another woman in my training collar and call her yours?*

"Because I can't." Anne's voice cracked. "Because if I open it, if I look at it, then you're really gone. And —"

*Gahh... good God, Mistress! You've had two years. Two years, six months, and however many damn days you've been counting. How much longer do you need?*

Anne closed her eyes. The tears came, silent and hot, sliding down her cheeks in the darkness.

"I... Jules... I... I don't know *how* to let you go," she said, her voice cracking with emotion. "I... I don't know how to stop *loving* you."

*You don't have to stop loving me, my beautiful, dumbass, stubborn Mistress! You just have to stop hiding behind me!*

Anne opened the box.

The collar lay inside, exactly as she'd left it — the one she'd soldered around Julia's throat on their fifth anniversary. The one Anne had cut from Julia's cold neck before the cremation. The metal was cleanly cleaved, a mute witness to a broken loop of service, love and devotion.

Anne picked it up. The metal was cold in her hands. She traced the cut edge with her thumb, feeling where her own saw had bitten through.

"I *miss* you, Jules," Anne said. "I miss you, every... fucking... day. I miss your laugh... and your stubbornness... and the way you *argued* with me about *every*thing. I miss the sound of your breathing at night. I miss your smell. I miss coming *home* to you."

The collar didn't answer. It was just a metal circlet, cool and inert.

"But you must know something, my Jules. She's *not* you." Anne's voice steadied. "And you know what? I don't *want* her to be *you.* Why would I want another cantankerous, hot tempered, stubborn redhead in my life? One of *you* is enough for a lifetime. Or two. Or ten. Amy... is something different. Something new. And I think... *that* something new is allowing me to live again, a better life, a life *after* you."

She stood there for a long time, holding the severed collar, quietly letting the resolution of her grief wash through her, without trying to stop it or control it in the least. When the tears finally subsided, Anne felt the catharsis coming to fruition. She felt... lighter, as if something that had been clenched tight inside her had finally let go.

Anne returned the collar to its box and closed the lid. This time, though, instead of putting the box back on the shelf by the jewellery box, she placed it in Julia's side of the closet, setting it down among the preserved remnants of a life that had ended.

"Thank you," she whispered. "For everything. For saving me. For teaching me, again, even through my thick skull. Thank you, for loving me and for holding my hand until I learned how to love again."

She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand and walked back to the bedroom. Julia's things would need to go to storage soon, Anne thought. After all, that side of the closet belonged to someone else.

Amy was still sleeping, her honey-blonde hair spread across the pillow, her collar dark against her milky throat. Anne slipped back into bed, gathered her close, and Amy murmured something indistinct and pressed closer without waking.

"I'm going to do this properly," Anne whispered into the darkness. "No more hiding. No more half-measures. If you're going to be mine, you deserve all of me. Not just the parts I feel safe giving."

Amy's breathing didn't change. Anne's arm tightened gently around Amy's waist.

Anne then closed her eyes, and, for the first time in over two years, she slept without dreaming of the past.

---

In the morning, Amy woke to find Anne sitting on the edge of the bed, watching her.

"Mistress?" Amy sat up, rubbing her eyes. "Is something wrong?"

"No." Anne reached out and touched Amy's face, tracing the line of her cheekbone. "Something is finally right."

"I don't understand."

"You don't need to. Not yet." Anne smiled, and Amy noticed that there was something different in that smile, a lightness that she had never seen before. It was as if a weight she hadn't known Anne was carrying had been lifted. 

"Amy... I want you to know that whatever happens with your family, whatever choices you have to make, I'm not going anywhere. This isn't a temporary fling. You're not a replacement for someone I lost. You're you, and that's enough. That's *more* than enough."

Amy felt tears prick her eyes. "Mistress..."

"I finally opened the box," Anne said quietly. "Last night, while you were sleeping, I said goodbye to her. For good."

Amy didn't have to ask which box. She took Anne's hand and pressed it to her lips.

"Are you okay, Anne?"

"I am now, Amy." Anne pulled Amy into her arms. "I am now."

They held each other in the morning light, as two women who had each lost something important to them — Amy her family, Anne the ghost of her grief — and found that what remained was brighter than what they had.

Outside, the valley stretched gold and green under the autumn sun. Inside, something new was taking root.

Amy's training would continue. The challenges would multiply. The world would intrude with its judgments and demands.

But for now, in this moment, they had each other.

And that meant *everything.*
