## Chapter Eight: The Ceremony
Autumn had deepened into winter, and winter had softened into the first, tentative stirrings of spring.

Amy remarked the change of season in small ways: the gradually shifting angle of the light flooding the studio windows at Sonoma State, the shift from bare branches to budding green along the commute from St. Helena, and the gradual warming of the earth in what she had come to think of as Julia’s garden. 

She had planted bulbs there in November, kneeling in the cold soil with dirt under her fingernails, Anne watching from the kitchen window, cradling a mug of hot tea. Now, in late February, the first crocuses were pushing through, small, defiant sparks of purple, white and gold, against the lingering chill.

It had been six months since the night when Anne had fastened Julia’s consideration collar around Amy’s throat.

In some ways, it felt as if no time had passed between then and now; in others, it felt like a lifetime ago – as if that girl who had been serving pancakes, eggs and hash browns at Marge’s Diner was a character in a novel Amy had read, a fictional person Amy understood, but could never inhabit.

School was starting its second semester now. The studio art programme at Sonoma State was rigorous in ways Amy hadn’t anticipated, demanding not just technical skill but also a willingness to be seen, to put her inner self on canvas and have it scrutinised by professors and peers alike. 

It was terrifying. 

It was exhilarating. 

It was, Amy was discovering, *exactly* what she needed.

Just last week, Professor Chen had said, “Your line work has gotten even more confident, Miss Castillo,” speaking as he studied Amy’s latest figure drawing – a woman reclining on a chaise, her body rendered in bold charcoal strokes that captured weight and presence without apology. “You’re not reacting to the form at all. You’re responding to it.”

Amy had ducked her head, embarrassment and pleasure flushing her cheeks, and thought of Anne. She remembered the hours spent in front of mirrors, learning to look. She remembered all the body acceptance work that had seemed impossible at first and now felt as natural as breathing.

Yes. 

She wasn’t *reacting* to the human form anymore. She was *responding* to it, thanks to Anne, who had pushed her to see she needed to stop reacting and start responding.

---

Anne noticed the change too.

She noticed it in the way Amy moved through the house now, without the nervous self-consciousness that had characterised her first weeks of service. She noticed it in the way Amy held herself during their evening rituals – back straight, shoulders relaxed, chin level, as if kneeling were simply another way of standing. She noticed it in the drawings that accumulated in Amy’s sketchbook, images that had progressed from tentative landscapes to bold studies of the human form, including several of Anne herself that made her breath catch whenever she looked at them.

But most of all, Anne noticed it in Amy’s eyes.

The uncertainty was gone. In its place was something steadier, something that met Anne’s gaze without flinching and held it with quiet assurance. It was the look of someone who knew who she was and had chosen, deliberately and without reservation, to be exactly that.

It was the look of a servant ready to become a slave.

Anne had been watching for it, waiting for it, the way a physician watches for the signs that tell her a patient has turned a corner. She had learned, in her years within the lifestyle, that this moment could not be rushed. A collar given too early was a burden; a collar given at the right time was a benediction.

The right time, she was beginning to believe, was now.

---

The goldsmith’s workshop was in a converted barn outside Healdsburg, down a winding road that seemed designed to discourage casual visitors.

Anne had found him through channels that predated her relationship with Julia – a network of artisans who understood that some commissions required discretion and others required something more: an understanding of what the object being created would mean to the people who would wear and bestow it.

Marcus Webb was in his sixties, with silver hair pulled back in a ponytail and hands that bore the scars of four decades working with precious metals. His workshop smelled of solder and flux and the particular mineral tang of metal being shaped by fire.

“Dr. Marquez! How good to see you again, darling.” 

He rose from his workbench as Anne entered, wiping his hands on a leather apron. “It’s been a long time, Anne”

“Too long, Marcus.” Anne clasped his offered hand. “I’m sorry I didn’t come sooner. After Julia…”

“I understood. We all did.” Marcus’s eyes were kind. “Grief has its own timeline. It doesn’t care about social niceties.”

“Yes, it doesn’t.”

He gestured to a stool near his bench, and Anne sat, watching as he returned to his work – a delicate filigree bracelet that seemed to be assembling itself under his fingers.

“You’re here about a collar,” he said. It wasn’t a question.

“Am I that transparent, Marcus?”

“Now that you mention it, yes.”

Both laughed good-naturedly.

“You’re right, though. I am here about a collar.” 

“For the young lady who wears Julia’s consideration collar?”

Anne wasn’t surprised that he knew. Marcus had made Julia’s permanent collar, fifteen years ago. He had also cut a segment from it after Julia’s death, reshaping the metal sliver into a small pendant that now hung on a chain in Anne’s jewellery box – a keepsake she could wear close to her heart without the weight of the full collar’s meaning.

“Yes. Her name is Amy,” Anne said. “She’s… she’s ready.”

Marcus set down his tools and turned to face her fully. “Are you?”

The question landed with the precision of a surgical instrument. Anne felt it probe at something tender, something she had thought healed but which still ached when pressed.

“I am,” she said, and found, as she said it, that it was true. “I’ve been ready for a while now. I guess… I was just waiting for her to catch up.”

“Riiiight.” Marcus teased as he smiled, poking gentle fun at Anne’s notorious stubbornness. 

“Tell me about her.”

Anne talked for nearly an hour. She described Amy’s journey from unconscious submissive to confident servant, her struggles with her family, her artistic awakening, her growing ease in her own skin. She described the way Amy knelt now, the way she served, the way she looked at Anne with eyes that held no doubt.

She described, without quite meaning to, the way Amy had drawn Julia from nothing but photographs and love letters, and how that drawing now hung in Anne’s study, a gift that had healed something Anne hadn’t known was still broken.

When she finished, Marcus was quiet for a long moment.

“Yellow gold will be a good metal for her,” he said finally. “It’ll be warm against her skin, and it’ll not be hard to pass the collar off as a choker. I think the most appropriate design for her is a flat band, perhaps three-eighths of an inch wide, with a subtle bevel on the edges so it sits comfortably.”

“I like that idea. Make it not completely snug too. Give it a little give, enough that she can slip a finger or two between the collar and her neck. Hygiene, you know.”

“Good point. And the engraving?”

Anne had thought about this. She had considered elaborate inscriptions, symbols, dates. But in the end, the answer had been simple.

“The engraving has to be discrete, Marcus. She goes to college, so it’ll have to be small, so that only someone in close proximity to her can see it. It should simply read Amy – Anne Marquez’s Slave. And on the clasp, an infinity symbol.”

Marcus nodded slowly. “It will take three weeks. Perhaps four. I don’t rush this kind of work.”

“I don’t want you to.”

“And the ceremony? Have you decided how you want to do it?”

Anne had been thinking about this too. The lifestyle community she had once been part of expected certain things – formal ceremonies at established venues, witnesses from the community, protocols observed and traditions honoured. Julia’s collaring had been at the Twin Roses, surrounded by friends and fellow practitioners, a public declaration of private commitment.

But Amy was not Julia. Their relationship was not the same. And Anne, after two years of solitude and six months of rebuilding, was not the same woman who had stood in that club twenty years ago, trembling with the weight of what she was about to do.

“I’d like it small, Marcus. Small… and private. It can be at my home, with people who matter.” 

She thought of the names, counting them on her fingers. “Thomas and Evelyn – they’ve known me since before Julia. Michael, if he can travel from Seattle. You, of course; and…” She hesitated. “And Master Roger, if he’s willing and still amongst us. I… lost touch with him.”

“Roger? Oh, he’s still around, alright. He’s semi-retired now, but still as sharp and smart as ever.” Anne smiled faintly hearing Marcus say so. She said, “he’s the one who… who saved me, who made me who I am. I’d like him to… to see what I’ve become, thanks to him.”

“I’ll reach out,” Marcus said. “We’ve kept in touch over the years. He speaks of you often, you know. His greatest success, he calls you.”

Anne felt her eyes sting. “I… I didn’t know that.”

“He’s a private man. But he is proud of you, Anne. Very proud.”

---

The weeks that followed were strange ones.

Anne had decided not to tell Amy about the collar. It was, she knew, a calculated choice – submission thrived on structure and certainty, and surprising a servant with something this significant could be destabilising. But there was a difference between a surprise and a revelation, and Anne wanted this to be the latter: a moment when Amy would look back and see that everything had been leading here, that the path had been clear all along even if she hadn’t been able to see it.

So, Anne continued their routines, rituals, quiet evenings and intimate mornings. She continued to train Amy, pushing her, praising her when she exceeded expectations and correcting her when she fell short. 

She watched Amy drive off to school each morning, and welcomed her home each evening, holding the secret of what was coming like a coal in her chest, warm, bright, and waiting to ignite.

Amy noticed something, of course. By now, she was much too attuned to Anne’s moods for her not to notice.

“You’re different lately, Mistress,” she said one evening as she comfortably sat at Anne’s feet, legs tucked under her body, while Anne read through medical journals. “Not in a bad way, though. Just… different.”

“Different how?”

Amy considered the question, her fingers tracing idle patterns on Anne’s ankle. “Lighter, maybe? Like you’re looking forward to something.”

“Perhaps I am.”

“Will you tell me what it is?”

“When the time is right.”

“That is very ‘International Man of Mystery,’ Mistress.”

“I’ve been told I might have a flair for the… dramatic.” 

“I would not know, Mistress, I have not seen you perform,” Amy said with a complicit smile, accepting Anne’s caginess. 

“Yes, you have, mine. Or… should I remind you what happens to your cheeks when you give me cheek?”

Six months ago, she would have pressed for information, worried, and spun anxious narratives about what Anne might be hiding. Now? she simply trusted Anne and giggled at the humorous innuendo.

It was, Anne thought, the most beautiful thing she had ever witnessed: trust, freely given, without conditions or reservations.

Soon, mine, she promised silently. Very soon.

---

The collar arrived on a Thursday afternoon in late March.

Marcus delivered it himself, driving up from Healdsburg in his battered pickup truck, the precious cargo secured in a leather case that he handed to Anne with the solemnity of a priest presenting a chalice.

“It’s some of my best work,” he said. “I think Julia would have approved.”

Anne opened the case, and the world stopped.

The collar lay on black velvet, gleaming in the afternoon light. It was exactly as she had imagined: a band of warm yellow gold, simple and elegant, with a concealed hinge on one side and a small, precise clasp on the other. The metal had been polished to a mirror finish, and when Anne lifted it, it caught the light and threw golden reflections across the walls.

She turned it counterclockwise. On the front, towards the right, Marcus’s careful engraving had etched *Amy – Anne Marquez’s Slave* in lettering small enough that one had to be within kissing distance to read them well. On the clasp, the infinity symbol was neatly etched into the metal as well, about as large as the lettering was.

“It’s perfect,” she breathed.

“There’s something else.” Marcus reached into his pocket and withdrew a smaller box. “A matching piece for you.”

Anne opened the box. Inside was a ring made from the same warm metal as the collar, with the infinity symbol engraved on the outside and, on the inside, words that made her heart stop. 
*Anne Marquez – Amy’s Mistress.*

“Marcus…”

“The collar binds her to you,” he said quietly. “This binds you to her. Ownership goes both ways, Anne. You taught me that, years ago, when you commissioned Julia’s collar. I thought you might want to remember that.”

Anne slipped the ring onto her finger. It fit perfectly, as if it had been made for her – which, of course, it had.

“Thank you,” she said. “For everything.”

“Thank me by being happy. That’s all the payment I need.”

---

The ceremony was set for a Saturday evening in early April.

Amy knew something was happening. Anne had told her that much – she had instructed her to keep the evening free, to prepare herself as she would for a formal occasion, and to trust that what was coming was good. But she hadn’t told her what, and Amy hadn’t asked.

The day itself dawned clear and warm, one of those California spring days that felt like a promise of summer. Amy spent the morning at the house, tidying rooms that were already immaculate, arranging flowers freshly picked from Julia’s garden in vases throughout the first floor. 

Anne had gone out early, running mysterious errands that she refused to explain, and wouldn’t return until late in the afternoon.

Impatient, nervous, and worried, Amy sifted through her clothes, trying to choose one that would be fitting for a formal occasion, flattered her form, revealed enough to be sexy without being overly slutty, and allowed her freedom of movement for when she served. She settled at last for a simple, white, above-the-knee pencil dress that let her shoulders and upper chest bare, showing just the right amount of cleavage. At her feet, a pair of strappy high heel sandals that went well with the dress. 

As usual, she wore nothing under the outfit. It had become her default way to clothe herself, even when she went to class. The only exception to this rule was when she was having her cycle, or when Anne told her to be dressed.

The training collar starkly contrasted with the candid garment. Amy brushed it with her fingertips. By now, it had become a trusty addition to her neck, one she had grown to love.

At about 3 PM, Amy went down. She had been told to expect guests starting at that time, so she waited, and waited, and waited.

As she paced back and forth along the living room, she did not notice a soft knock on the door and, when she did not answer, the slight creak it made when opened.

“You’re going to wear a groove in the floor,” said a voice from the doorway.

“Ah!”

Amy turned, startled. A calm, strong man in his mid-sixties stood at the threshold, with close-cropped grey hair and the compact, economical build of someone who had maintained discipline over his body for decades. 

He wore an impeccably tailored, simple black suit, and carried himself with the quiet authority of someone who had never needed to raise his voice to be obeyed.

“Forgive me, Sir” Amy said, kneeling to present at once, her servant’s instincts surfacing immediately. “I didn’t hear you come in. How may I serve?”

The man’s smile was slight but warm, crinkling the corners of eyes that seemed to catalogue everything they saw. “It’s been a long time since anyone called me Sir. I’m Roger. Roger Fukuyama. Anne’s…”

“You’re Anne’s Master,” Amy breathed, recognising the name at once.

“Yes. I was her Master,” Roger corrected gently. “That was a long time ago, though. Now… I’m just a man who wanted to see what his best student has been up to.” 

He moved into the room with the easy grace of someone entirely comfortable in his own skin. “You must be Amy.”

“Yes, Sir.” Roger made a slight upward sign with a hand. Amy immediately stood up and went close to him.

“She talks about you all the time when she calls me, you know,” Roger said as his gaze inspected Amy with a thoroughness and care that only comes to someone who had spent a lifetime reading people. 

“For two years after Julia, she didn’t call at all. Grief, when unresolved, can be more deadly than the worst illness. I thought I’d lost her.” He stopped in front of Amy, crouched, and his expression softened. “Then, six weeks ago, she called. And… she was alive again, Because of you. How glad I am she found someone who helped her come out of her bereavement cocoon. How glad I am that she found you.”

Amy felt tears threatening. “I… I didn’t do anything, Sir. She saved me, not the other way around.”

“That’s how it works, when it works well.” Roger reached out and touched the consideration collar at Amy’s throat – Julia’s collar, worn smooth by months of constant contact. “You save each other. That’s the whole point.”

The others arrived as the sun began its descent toward the western hills.

Thomas came first, a broad-shouldered Black man in his late fifties with a shaved head and a laugh that seemed to start somewhere around his belly and work its way up. He had been Anne’s first friend in the lifestyle, she would later learn – a fellow newcomer at a munch in San Francisco thirty years ago, both of them too nervous to speak to anyone until they’d found each other by the punch bowl. He swept Amy into a hug before she could offer her hand.

“So you’re the one,” he said, holding her at arm’s length to look at her. “Anne said you were special. She undersold it.”

“Thomas, stop overwhelming the poor girl.” Evelyn appeared behind him, a willowy woman with silver-streaked auburn hair and the kind of bone structure that suggested she had been devastating in her youth and had only grown more striking with age. Where Thomas was warmth and volume, Evelyn was precision and poise. “You’ll have plenty of time to interrogate her later.”

“I wasn’t interrogating. I was appreciating.”

“You were being a puppy,” Evelyn said. She then kissed Amy’s cheek, her perfume something subtle and expensive. “Don’t mind him, dear. He gets excited.” She pressed a small package into Amy’s hands – a box wrapped in deep blue velvet, tied with silver ribbon. “For later. A gift from the community. From those of us who remember what it means to kneel for the first time and mean it forever.”

Marcus was next, wearing a clean, black leather jacket, dark blue jeans, old, well worn combat boots, and a soft smile that softened even more when he saw the company gathered there. Roger and him soon went off to a side, catching up, drinking whisky on ice, and reminiscing.

The last to arrive was Michael – tall, quiet, with the weathered handsomeness of someone who spent more time outdoors than in. He had flown in from Seattle, and there was something careful in the way he moved through the house, as if he were navigating a space full of memories.

He stopped at the mantle, looking at the photographs there, showing Anne and Julia at various ages, in various places, always with that particular energy between them that spoke of a connection deeper than the photographs could capture.

Amy met and greeted all the people who had gathered, then found a place near Julia’s photos, close to Michael.

“Julia… talked a lot about Anne during those last months, when she knew she was dying.” His voice was quiet, meant only for Amy. “She wasn’t afraid for herself. She was afraid for Anne, and of what would happen to her when she was gone.” He turned, finally, and his eyes were bright with unshed tears. “She’d be… so glad to know Anne found you.”

Amy didn’t know what to say. She reached out and touched his arm, and Michael covered her hand with his own.

“Take care of her,” he said. “That’s all any of us want. Just… take care of her.”

“I will,” Amy promised. “I swear I will.”

Finally, Anne came home.

She came through the front door as the last light was painting the valley in shades of amber and rose, and Amy’s breath caught at the sight of her. She wore deep burgundy dress, simple in cut but devastating in effect, and her dark hair was swept up to reveal the elegant line of her neck. She moved through the room greeting her guests, and accepting their embraces, but her eyes always kept returning to Amy.

“Come with me,” Anne said finally, extending her hand. “It’s time.”

“Time for what, Mistress?”

This time, Anne’s caginess was gone. Anne said, “It is time for you to take your place, mine.”

Amy’s legs almost buckled under her. The pieces fell together all of a sudden in her mind, and the weight of what Anne was about to do sank in Amy’s heart.

Anne was about to give her a slave’s collar. The last one she’d ever wear. Trembling, she said, “I… it will be my honour to take it, Mistress.”

---

The ceremony took place in the dining room, with the windows thrown open to the spring evening and the scent of jasmine drifting in from the garden.

Anne had arranged the space with care: candles on every surface, casting warm, flickering light; chairs arranged in a loose semicircle for the witnesses; and, at the centre, a single cushion where Amy would kneel.

Leaning to Amy, she said, “Are you ready, my girl?”

“As ready as I will ever be, Mistress.”

Roger had agreed to officiate, his voice carrying the weight of decades as he spoke the traditional words – questions of intent, declarations of commitment, the formal language of the lifestyle given shape and gravity by his presence.

“Anne Marquez,” he said, “do you come here freely, without coercion, to claim this woman as your slave?”

“I do, Master.”

“Do you understand the weight of what you undertake? The responsibility of absolute ownership, the duty of care and protection, the commitment to guide and nurture and discipline as needed?”

“I understand, Master.”

“And do you swear, before these witnesses and whatever powers you acknowledge, that you will honour this bond as sacred, maintaining it with integrity until such time as it is dissolved by mutual consent or the absence of one of you two?”

“I swear it, Master.”

Roger then turned to Amy. 

“Amy Castillo, do you come here freely, without coercion, to surrender yourself to this woman as her slave?”

Amy’s voice was steady. “I do, Master.”

“Do you understand that you are surrendering your body, your will, and your service into your Mistress’s keeping, to be shaped and directed according to her wisdom?”

“I understand, Master.”

“And do you swear, before these witnesses and whatever powers you acknowledge, that you will honour this bond as sacred, serving with devotion and obedience until such time as it is dissolved by mutual consent or the absence of one of you two?”

“I swear it, Master.”

Roger nodded slowly. “Let the slave’s collar be presented.”

Anne stepped forward, and in her hands was a leather case that Amy had never seen before. She opened it, and Amy’s breath left her entirely.

In it, a collar gleamed in reflections that reminisced a summer dawn, warm under the candlelight, simple, perfect and unmistakably permanent. This was not a leather strap that could be unbuckled. The solid grace of the metal circlet that would embrace Amy’s throat, and stay there, was a statement that none could question or challenge without consequence.

“This collar,” Anne said, her voice thick with emotion, “was made for you, Amy. It carries your name, and mine, and a promise that will bind us together for as long as we both shall live.” 

She moved closer, Roger holding the collar case between them like an offering. 

“Amy… I ask you one last time… Are you certain? Once this collar closes, there is no going back. You will be my slave – wholly, completely, irrevocably mine. Is this what your heart wants?”

Amy looked at the collar, then at Anne. She thought about the girl she had been six months ago – lost, uncertain, waiting for something she couldn’t name. She thought about the woman she had become, confident, and most importantly, purposeful.

“Yes, Mistress,” she said. “This… is everything my heart wants.”

Anne reached for Julia’s consideration collar – the leather strap that had been the first tangible proof of Amy’s path to a new life. Her fingers found the clasp, and she paused.

“Thank you,” Anne said softly, speaking to the collar, to the woman who had worn it first. “Thank you for letting me borrow it. Thank you for leading me to her.”

She removed the collar and set it aside with reverence. Amy’s neck felt strange without it, bare and vulnerable, and she shivered in the warm evening air.

Then Anne brought the gold collar to Amy’s throat.

The metal was startlingly cool at first against Amy’s warm skin. She shivered a little, starting to realise how final this act was.

Anne positioned the collar carefully, the concealed hinge on the left side, the clasp on the right, and then, with a soft, precise click, it was locked.

The sound was quiet, but it echoed through Amy like a thunderclap.

The collar was neither tight nor loose. It fit perfectly, as if it had been designed around the exact measurements of her neck, which, Amy realised, it had been. The gold band warmed quickly against her skin, taking on her body heat until it felt less like something worn and more like something grown, an extension of herself that had always been there, waiting to be revealed.

Amy reached up to touch it, fingers tracing the smooth metal, finding the slight ridge where the clasp had sealed, and the slight groove of the engraving on the collar. 

“There is no key, mine,” Anne said. Then, with a grin, she says. “No, there is a key – it is my heart.” She then took Amy’s hand and pressed something into her palm. 

“And this… is for you.”

Amy looked down. It was a ring, made of the same material as her collar, with an infinity symbol engraved on the outside, the same that was on the collar’s clasp..

“Look inside,” Anne said.

Amy turned the ring toward the candlelight and read: 

*Anne Marquez – Amy’s Mistress.*

The tears came then, hot and unstoppable, streaming down Amy’s face as she understood what Anne was saying. This was not just an act of taking ownership, but of affirming that Anne belonged with Amy just as much as Amy belonged with Anne. 

The ring meant so much more than possession. it meant commitment. 

The collar marked Amy as Anne’s slave – but the ring marked Anne as Amy’s Mistress, binding both of them together, surely, permanently.

“Will you put it on me, mine?” Anne asked, her own voice unsteady.

Amy’s hands trembled as she took Anne’s left hand and slipped the ring onto her finger. It fit perfectly, of course. Marcus had made sure of that.

“By the authority invested in me by tradition and trust,” Roger said, his voice carrying the words with the gravity they deserved, “I declare this bond sealed. Amy Castillo is now and forevermore the slave of Anne Marquez. May their bond bring them joy, growth, and the peace that comes from knowing one’s place in the world.”

The witnesses applauded softly, but Amy barely heard them. She was looking at Anne, at the tears on her Mistress’s cheeks, at the ring gleaming on her finger, at the love in her dark eyes.

“Hello, Mine,” Anne said softly.

“Hello, my Mistress,” Amy whispered back. “I… I am home.”

---

The formal part of the evening had ended, and the gathering had melded into a gathering of old friends with glasses in hand, their voices overlapping, enjoying the evening with the particular ease that came from years of shared history and understanding. Amy stood by the window, still touching her collar every few seconds as if to confirm it was real. The gold was warm now, indistinguishable from her own skin temperature, and yet she couldn’t stop reaching for it and feel the engraving. 

All of a sudden, she caught Anne out of the corner of her eye, discretely waving. When Amy beheld her from across the room, Anne… winked.

It was such a small, playful, conspiratorial gesture that Amy giggled, discretely covering her mouth.

This woman, who had just claimed her as property with solemn words and metal, who had slipped a ring onto her own finger in declaration of mutual belonging, was winking at her like a schoolgirl with a secret. She even put a finger to her lips!

Then Anne began to move.

She drifted through the small gathering with apparent aimlessness, making small talk with all. With Michael first, reminiscing about their mutual absent friend; then pausing to touch Thomas’s arm, and murmur something that made him smile. But Amy, watching, saw the trajectory and spotted Anne’s mark.

Master Roger stood with his back to the room, deep in conversation with Evelyn about something that required emphatic hand gestures on her part. He didn’t see Anne approaching. He didn’t see her grin sharpen into something mischievous.

He didn’t see her hand drift toward his jacket pocket in a gesture so theatrical it belonged in a silent film.

But he felt it.

Roger’s hand came down and caught Anne’s wrist – an interception so casual it spoke of decades of practice. He didn’t even break his conversation with Evelyn. He simply held Anne’s wrist a few more moments and turned her to face him.

“Anne…” His voice carried the particular weight of a Master addressing a former charge. “… Do you remember what happened last time you tried to pilfer something from me?”

Anne’s expression was utterly unrepentant. “I was your slave for five years, Master – and that saved me.”

“Well, don’t pilfer from me… or I will have to punish you again.”

“I quake in fear, Master.” Anne pressed a hand to her chest in mock terror. “What could you possibly do to little old me?”

Roger opened his mouth, closed it, and then burst in a warm and heartfelt guffaw. Everybody else, who had turned to watch Anne’s shenanigans, was laughing heartily as well.

“You’re right, damn it. I can’t do anything to you anymore.” His eyes crinkled with affection as he glanced past Anne to where Amy stood watching. “Besides, having Amy as your charge is punishment enough.”

“Hey,” Amy said, before she could stop herself.

The room turned to look at her. For a moment, Amy felt the old panic rise – she had spoken out of turn, she had interrupted, she had —

But everyone was smiling – and laughing. Even Evelyn, whom Amy had found slightly terrifying.

“She has spirit, Anne,” Roger observed. Then, to Amy, he said, “I like your attitude, child. You’ll need it, too. Your Mistress is…” He searched for the word.

“Incorrigible?” Evelyn supplied.

“I was going to say relentless, but… Yeah. Incorrigible and relentless. A real pest, in short.”

“I *heard* that!” said a very heartily smiling Anne. She then crossed back to Amy and slipped an arm around her waist. “Don’t listen to them, mine,” she whispered. “They’re just jealous.”

“Of what?” Amy asked.

Anne pressed a kiss to her temple. “Of how lucky I am.”

Later, after the guests had departed with embraces and well-wishes, after the candles had burned low and the spring night had deepened into darkness, Anne led Amy to their bedroom.

“How does it feel?” Anne asked, her fingers tracing the collar that would now never leave Amy’s throat.

“Like it was always there,” Amy said. “Like I was born with it and just didn’t know.”

Anne kissed her forehead, her cheeks, her lips. “I have one more gift for you. Close your eyes.”

Amy obeyed. She heard Anne move across the room, heard a drawer open and close, heard footsteps returning.

“Open them.”

Anne stood before her, holding a frame. Inside the frame was a drawing – Amy’s drawing, the portrait of Julia she had made on that morning months ago, now matted and preserved behind glass.

“I wanted to hang it here, in our bedroom,” Anne said. “So that she can see us and be part of this, even now.” She met Amy’s eyes. “Is that all right?”

Amy thought about Julia. About the woman who had loved Anne first, who had served her and challenged her and made her who she was. About the ghost who had haunted this house and who had, somehow, made room for Amy to belong here too.

“Yes, Mistress,” she said. “That’s perfect.”

Anne hung the portrait on the wall opposite the bed, where the morning light would touch it first. Then she turned back to Amy, her expression shifting into something deeper, something hungry.

“My slave,” Anne said, and the word was different now – not a term of endearment but a statement of fact, a truth written in gold around Amy’s throat. “My beautiful, perfect, owned slave.”

“Yours, Mistress. Completely yours.”

Anne pulled her close. The collar pressed between them, warm metal against warm skin, and Amy felt herself dissolving into the embrace, into the certainty of belonging, into the peace she had spent her whole life searching for without knowing it.

With a naughty smile, Amy said, “Does this mean I get a nicer doghouse now, my beloved, kleptomaniac Mistress?”

Anne’s laugh came from the heart, loud and sincere.

“You… you… you impossible creature!” 

“Yes, Mistress – but not just an impossible creature. I am your impossible creature.”

Outside, the valley lay quiet under a sky full of stars. Inside, two women held each other, bound together by gold and promises and the stubborn human insistence on connection.
